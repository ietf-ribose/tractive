This is useful in cases when CamelCase style is used to name code artefacts like class names and there is no corresponding page for them. This option can be set in `ignore_missing_pages` in the [wiki:TracIni#wiki-section \"[wiki]\"] section of TracIni.\n * To automatically insert space characters between the words of a CamelCase link when rendering the link, use `split_page_names` in the [wiki:TracIni#wiki-section \"[wiki]\"] section of TracIni.\n * Creation of explicit Wiki links is also easy, see WikiPageNames for details.\n * Wiki formatting can be disabled completely in some places, for example when rendering commit log messages.

An !InterTrac link can be seen as a scoped TracLinks. It is used for referring to a Trac resource located in another Trac environment. A resource can be a wiki page, changeset, ticket or milestone. \n\n== List of Active InterTrac Prefixes\n\n[[InterTrac]]\n\n== Link Syntax\n\nSimply use the name of the other Trac environment as a prefix, followed by a colon, ending with the resource located in the other environment:\n\n{{{\n<target_environment>:<TracLinks>\n}}}\n\nThe other resource is specified using a regular TracLinks, of any flavor.\n\nThat target environment name is either the real name of the environment or an alias for it. \nThe aliases are defined in the `trac.ini` file, see below.\nThe prefix is case insensitive.\n\nIf the InterTrac link is enclosed in square brackets, like `[th:WikiExtrasPlugin]`, the InterTrac prefix is removed in the displayed link like a normal link resolver would be, ie the above would be displayed as `WikiExtrasPlugin`.\n\nFor convenience, there is also an alternative short-hand form, where an alias can be used as an immediate prefix for the identifier of a ticket, changeset or report, eg `#T234`, `[T1508]`, `[trac 1508]`.\n\n== Examples\n\nIt is necessary to set up a configuration for the InterTrac facility.\nThis configuration has to be done in the TracIni file, `[intertrac]` section, for example:\n\n{{{#!ini\n[intertrac]\n# -- Example of setting up an alias:\nt = trac\n\n# -- Link to an external Trac:\ntrac.title = Edgewall\'s Trac for Trac\ntrac.url = http://trac.edgewall.org\n}}}\n\nThe `.url` is mandatory and is used for locating the other Trac.\nThis can be a relative URL in case that Trac environment is located on the same server.\n\nThe `.title` information is used in a tooltip, ie when hovering the cursor over an InterTrac link.\n\nFinally, the `.compat` option can be used to enable or disable a \'\'compatibility\'\' mode:\n * If the targeted Trac is running a version below [trac:milestone:0.10 0.10] ([trac:r3526 r3526] to be precise), then it doesn\'t know how to dispatch an InterTrac link, and it is up to the local Trac to prepare the correct link. Not all links will work that way, but the most common ones do. This is called the compatibility mode, and is `false` by default. \n * If you know that the remote Trac knows how to dispatch InterTrac links, you can explicitly disable this compatibility mode and then \'\'any\'\' TracLinks can become an InterTrac link.\n\nNow, given the above configuration, one could create the following links:\n * to this InterTrac page:\n   * `trac:wiki:InterTrac` trac:wiki:InterTrac\n   * `t:wiki:InterTrac` t:wiki:InterTrac\n   * Keys are case insensitive: `T:wiki:InterTrac` T:wiki:InterTrac\n * to the ticket #234:\n   * `trac:ticket:234` trac:ticket:234\n   * `trac:#234` trac:#234 \n   * `#T234` #T234\n * to the changeset [1912]:\n   * `trac:changeset:1912` trac:changeset:1912\n   * `[T1912]` [T1912]\n * to the log range [3300:3330]: \'\'\'Note\'\'\': the following ones need `trac.compat=false`:\n   * `trac:log:@3300:3330` trac:log:@3300:3330  \n   * `[trac 3300:3330]` [trac 3300:3330] \n * finally, to link to the start page of a remote Trac, simply use its prefix followed by a colon `:` and inside an explicit link. Example: `[th: Trac Hacks]`. Since Trac 0.11, note that the \'\'remote\'\' Trac has to run at least version 0.11 for this to work.\n\nThe generic form `intertrac_prefix:module:id` is translated to the corresponding URL `<remote>/module/id`, shorthand links are specific to some modules (e.g. !#T234 is processed by the ticket module) and for the rest (`intertrac_prefix:something`), we rely on the TracSearch#quickjump facility of the remote Trac.\n\n----\nSee also: TracLinks, InterWiki',NULL,NULL),('InterWiki',1,1629200947630000,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Support for InterWiki links\n\n== Definition\n\nAn InterWiki link can be used for referring to a Wiki page located in another Wiki system, and by extension, to any object located in any other Web application, provided a simple URL mapping can be done.\n\nInterWiki prefixes can even be used to simply introduce links to new protocols, such as `tsvn:` used by [trac:TortoiseSvn TortoiseSvn].\n\n== Link Syntax\n\n{{{\n<target_wiki>(:<identifier>)+\n}}}\n\nThe link is composed by the targeted Wiki (or system) name, followed by a colon, eg `MeatBall:`, followed by a page specification in the target.\nNote that, as for InterTrac prefixes, \'\'\'InterWiki prefixes are case insensitive\'\'\'.\n\nThe target Wiki URL is looked up in the `[interwiki]` section of TracIni or in the InterMapTxt wiki page, modeled after MeatBall:InterMapTxt. If a prefix is defined in both the `[interwiki]` section and InterMapTxt, the `[interwiki]` section takes precedence.\n\nIn addition to traditional InterWiki links, where the target is simply \'\'appended\'\' to the URL, Trac supports parametric InterWiki URLs:\nidentifiers `$1`, `$2`, ... in the URL will be replaced by corresponding arguments.\nThe argument list is formed by splitting the page identifier using the \":\" separator.\n\n=== [interwiki]\n\nEvery option in the `[interwiki]` section in TracIni defines one InterWiki prefix.

This tool can be used to configure and customize your Trac-installation to better fit your needs.\n\nSome of those configurations can also be performed via the web administration module.\n\n== Usage\n\nFor nearly every `trac-admin` command, you will need to specify the path to the TracEnvironment that you want to administer as the first argument:\n{{{\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv wiki list\n}}}\n\nThe only exception is for the `help` command, but even in this case if you omit the environment, you will only get a very succinct list of commands (`help` and `initenv`), the same list you would get when invoking `trac-admin` alone.\nAlso, `trac-admin --version` will tell you about the Trac version (e.g. 0.12) corresponding to the program.\n\nTo get a comprehensive list of the available commands and sub-commands, specify an existing environment:\n{{{\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv help\n}}}\n\nSome commands have a more detailed help, which you can access by specifying the command\'s name as a subcommand for `help`:\n{{{\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv help <command>\n}}}\n\n=== `trac-admin <targetdir> initenv` === #initenv\n\nThis subcommand is very important as is the one used to create a TracEnvironment in the specified `<targetdir>`. That directory must not exist prior to the call.\n\n[[TracAdminHelp(initenv)]]\n\nIt supports an extra `--inherit` option, which can be used to specify a global configuration file which can be used to share settings between several environments. You can also inherit from a shared configuration afterwards, by setting the `[inherit] file` option in the `conf/trac.ini` file in your newly created environment, but the advantage of specifying the inherited configuration file at environment creation time is that only the options \'\'not\'\' already specified in the global configuration file will be written in the created environment\'s `conf/trac.ini` file.\nSee TracIni#GlobalConfiguration.\n\nNote that in version 0.11 of Trac, `initenv` lost an extra last argument `<templatepath>`, which was used in previous versions to point to the `templates` folder. If you are using the one-liner `trac-admin /path/to/trac/ initenv <projectname> <db> <repostype> <repospath>` in the above and get an error that reads `Wrong number of arguments to initenv: 4`, then this is because you are using a `trac-admin` script from an \'\'\'older\'\'\' version of Trac.\n\n== Interactive Mode\n\nWhen passing the environment path as the only argument, `trac-admin` starts in interactive mode.\nCommands can then be executed on the selected environment using the prompt, which offers tab-completion\n(on non-Windows environments, and when the Python `readline` module is available) and automatic repetition of the last command issued.\n\nOnce you are in interactive mode, you can also get help on specific commands or subsets of commands:\n\nFor example, to get an explanation of the `resync` command, run:\n{{{\n$ help resync\n}}}\n\nTo get help on all the Wiki-related commands, run:\n{{{\n$ help wiki\n}}}\n\n== Full Command Reference\n\nYou will find below the detailed help for all the commands available by default in `trac-admin`. Note that this may not match the list given by `trac-admin <yourenv> help`, as the commands pertaining to components disabled in that environment won\'t be available and conversely some plugins activated in the environment can add their own commands.\n\n[[TracAdminHelp()]]\n\n----\nSee also: TracGuide, TracBackup, TracPermissions, TracEnvironment, TracIni, [trac:TracMigrate TracMigrate]\n',NULL,NULL),('TracBackup',1,1629200947537654,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac Backup\n\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nTrac backups are simply a copied snapshot of the entire [wiki:TracEnvironment project environment] directory, including the database.

When such a default repository is present, its top-level files and directories are also listed, in a \'\'\'Default Repository\'\'\' section placed before the repository index. If the default repository is the only repository associated with the Trac environment, then the \'\'\'Repository Index\'\'\' will be omitted. This means that after upgrading a single-repository Trac of version 0.11 (or earlier) to a multi-repository Trac (0.12), the repository browser will look and feel the same, that single repository becoming automatically the \"default\" repository.\n\nDirectory entries are displayed in a list with sortable columns. The list entries can be sorted by \'\'Name\'\', \'\'Size\'\', \'\'Age\'\' or \'\'Author\'\' by clicking on the column headers. The sort order can be reversed by clicking on a given column header again.\n\nThe browser can be used to navigate through the directory structure by clicking on the directory names. \nClicking on a file name will show the contents of the file. \nClicking on the revision number of a file or directory will take you to the TracRevisionLog for that file.\nNote that there\'s also a \'\'Revision Log\'\' navigation link that will do the same for the path currently being examined.\nClicking on the \'\'diff\'\' icon after revision number will display the changes made to the files modified in that revision.\nClicking on the \'\'Age\'\' of the file - will take you to that changeset in the timeline.\n\nIt\'s also possible to browse directories or files as they were in history, at any given repository revision. The default behavior is to display the latest revision but another revision number can easily be selected using the \'\'View revision\'\' input field at the top of the page.\n\nThe color bar next to the \'\'Age\'\' column gives a visual indication of the age of the last change to a file or directory, following the convention that \'\'\'[[span(style=color:#88f,blue)]]\'\'\' is oldest and \'\'\'[[span(style=color:#f88,red)]]\'\'\' is newest, but this can be [TracIni#browser-section configured].\n\nAt the top of the browser page, there\'s a \'\'Visit\'\' drop-down menu which you can use to select some interesting places in the repository, for example branches or tags. \nThis is sometimes referred to as the \'\'browser quickjump\'\' facility.\nThe precise meaning and content of this menu depends on your repository backend.\nFor Subversion, this list contains by default the top-level trunk directory and sub-directories of the top-level branches and tags directories (`/trunk`, `/branches/*`, and `/tags/*`). This can be [TracIni#svn-section configured] for more advanced cases.\n\nIf you\'re using a Javascript enabled browser, you\'ll be able to expand and collapse directories in-place by clicking on the arrow head at the right side of a directory. Alternatively, the [trac:TracAccessibility keyboard] can also be used for this: \n - use `j` and `k` to select the next or previous entry, starting with the first\n - `o` (\'\'\'o\'\'\'pen) to toggle between expanded and collapsed state of the selected \n   directory or for visiting the selected file \n - `v` (\'\'\'v\'\'\'iew, \'\'\'v\'\'\'isit) and `<Enter>`, same as above\n - `r` can be used to force the \'\'\'r\'\'\'eload of an already expanded directory\n - `a` can be used to directly visit a file in \'\'\'a\'\'\'nnotate (blame) mode\n - `l` to view the \'\'\'l\'\'\'og for the selected entry\nIf no row has been selected using `j` or `k` these keys will operate on the entry under the mouse.\n\nFor the Subversion backend, some advanced additional features are available:\n - The `svn:needs-lock` property will be displayed.\n - Support for the `svn:mergeinfo` property showing the merged and eligible information.\n - Support for browsing the `svn:externals` property, which can be [TracIni#svn:externals-section configured].\n - The `svn:mime-type` property is used to select the syntax highlighter for rendering the file. For example, setting `svn:mime-type` to `text/html` will ensure the file is highlighted as HTML, regardless of the file extension. It also allows selecting the character encoding used in the file content. For example, if the file content is encoded in UTF-8, set `svn:mime-type` to `text/html;charset=utf-8`.

The `trac.cgi` script can be created using the `trac-admin <env> deploy <dir>` command which automatically substitutes the required paths, see TracInstall#cgi-bin. Make sure the script is executable by your web server.\n\n== Apache web-server configuration\n\nIn [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] there are two ways to run Trac as CGI:\n\n 1. Use a `ScriptAlias` directive that maps an URL to the `trac.cgi` script (recommended)\n 1. Copy the `trac.cgi` file into the directory for CGI executables used by your web server (commonly named `cgi-bin`). You can also create a symbolic link, but in that case make sure that the `FollowSymLinks` option is enabled for the `cgi-bin` directory.\n\nTo make Trac available at `http://yourhost.example.org/trac` add `ScriptAlias` directive to Apache configuration file, changing `trac.cgi` path to match your installation:\n{{{#!apache\nScriptAlias /trac /path/to/www/trac/cgi-bin/trac.cgi\n}}}\n\n \'\'Note that this directive requires enabled `mod_alias` module.\'\'\n\nIf you\'re using Trac with a single project you need to set its location using the `TRAC_ENV` environment variable:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location \"/trac\">\n  SetEnv TRAC_ENV \"/path/to/projectenv\"\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nOr to use multiple projects you can specify their common parent directory using the `TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR` variable:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location \"/trac\">\n  SetEnv TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR \"/path/to/project/parent/dir\"\n</Location>\n}}}\n\n \'\'Note that the `SetEnv` directive requires enabled `mod_env` module. It is also possible to set TRAC_ENV in trac.cgi. Just add the following code between \"try:\" and \"from trac.web ...\":\'\'\n\n{{{#!python\n    import os\n    os.environ[\'TRAC_ENV\'] = \"/path/to/projectenv\"\n}}}\n\n \'\' Or for TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR: \'\'\n\n{{{#!python\n    import os\n    os.environ[\'TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR\'] = \"/path/to/project/parent/dir\"\n}}}\n\nIf you are using the [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html Apache suEXEC] feature please see [trac:ApacheSuexec].\n\nOn some systems, you \'\'may\'\' need to edit the shebang line in the `trac.cgi` file to point to your real Python installation path. On a Windows system you may need to configure Windows to know how to execute a .cgi file (Explorer -> Tools -> Folder Options -> File Types -> CGI).\n\n=== Using WSGI\n\nYou can run a [http://henry.precheur.org/python/how_to_serve_cgi WSGI handler] [http://pythonweb.org/projects/webmodules/doc/0.5.3/html_multipage/lib/example-webserver-web-wsgi-simple-cgi.html under CGI].

Some correspond to revisions made in the repositories, others aggregate changes made in several revisions. Ultimately, any kind of difference can be shown.\n\nThe changeset view consists of two parts, the \'\'header\'\' and the \'\'diff views\'\'.\n\n== Changeset Header\n\nThe header shows an overview of the whole changeset.\nHere you will find information such as:\n\n * Timestamp — When the changeset was commited\n * Author — Who commited the changeset\n * Message — A brief description from the author (the commit log message)\n * Location — Parent directory of all files affected by this changeset\n * Files — A list of files affected by this changeset\n\nIf more than one revision is involved in the set of changes being displayed, the \'\'Timestamp\'\', \'\'Author\'\' and \'\'Message\'\' fields will not be shown.\n\nA colored rectangle indicates how the file is affected by the changeset:\n \n [[span(style=background:#bfb;border:1px solid #999;font-size:80%;margin-right:.5em,\'\'  \'\')]] Green: Added \\\\\n [[span(style=background:#f88;border:1px solid #999;font-size:80%;margin-right:.5em,\'\'  \'\')]] Red: Removed \\\\\n [[span(style=background:#fd8;border:1px solid #999;font-size:80%;margin-right:.5em,\'\'  \'\')]] Yellow: Modified \\\\\n [[span(style=background:#88f;border:1px solid #999;font-size:80%;margin-right:.5em,\'\'  \'\')]] Blue: Copied \\\\\n [[span(style=background:#ccc;border:1px solid #999;font-size:80%;margin-right:.5em,\'\'  \'\')]] Gray: Moved \\\\\nThe color legend is located below the header as a reminder.\n\n== Diff Views\n\nBelow the header is the main part of the changeset, the diff view. Each file is shown in a separate section, each of which contains only the regions of the file that are affected by the changeset. There are two different styles to display the diffs: \'\'inline\'\' or \'\'side-by-side\'\'. You can switch between the styles using the preferences form:\n\n * The \'\'inline\'\' style shows the changed regions of a file underneath each other. A region removed from the file will be colored red, an added region will be colored green. If a region was modified, the old version is displayed above the new version. Line numbers indicate the exact position of the change in both the old and the new version of the file.\n * The \'\'side-by-side\'\' style shows the old version on the left and the new version on the right and this will typically require more screen width than the inline style. Added and removed regions will be colored in the same way as with the inline style (green and red), and modified regions will have a yellow background.\n\nIn addition, various advanced options are available in the preferences form for adjusting the display of the diffs:\n * You can set how many lines are displayed before and after every change; if the value \'\'all\'\' is used, then the full file will be shown.\n * You can toggle whether blank lines, case changes and white space changes are ignored, thereby letting you find the functional changes more quickly.\n\n== The Different Ways to Get a Diff\n\n=== Examining a Changeset\n\nWhen viewing a repository check-in, such as when following a changeset [wiki:TracLinks link] or a changeset event in the [wiki:TracTimeline timeline], Trac will display the exact changes made by the check-in.\n\nThere will be also navigation links to the \'\'Previous Changeset\'\' to and \'\'Next Changeset\'\'.\n\n=== Examining Differences Between Revisions\n\nOften you want to look at changes made on a file or on a directory spanning multiple revisions. The easiest way to get there is from the TracRevisionLog, where you can select the \'\'old\'\' and the \'\'new\'\' revisions of the file or directory, and then click the \'\'View changes\'\' button.\n\n=== Examining Differences Between Branches\n\nOne of the core features of version control systems is the possibility to work simultaneously on different \'\'Lines of Developments\'\', commonly called \"branches\". Trac enables you to examine the exact differences between such branches.\n\nUsing the \'\'\'View changes ...\'\'\' button in the TracBrowser allows you to enter \'\'From:\'\' and \'\'To:\'\' path/revision pairs. The resulting set of differences consist of the changes that should be applied to the \'\'From:\'\' content to get to the \'\'To:\'\' content.\n\nFor convenience, it is possible to invert the roles of the \'\'old\'\' and the \'\'new\'\' path/revision pairs by clicking the \'\'Reverse Diff\'\' link on the changeset page.\n\n=== Checking the Last Change\n\nAnother way to examine changes is to use the \'\'Last Change\'\' link provided by the TracBrowser.\n\nThis link will take you to the last change that was made on that path. From there, you can use the \'\'Previous Change\'\' and \'\'Next Change\'\' links to traverse the change history of the file or directory.\n\n----\nSee also: TracGuide, TracBrowser',NULL,NULL),('TracEnvironment',1,1629200947622312,'trac','127.0.0.1','= The Trac Environment\n\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n[[PageOutline(2-5,Contents,pullout)]]\n\nTrac uses a directory structure and a database for storing project data. The directory is referred to as the \'\'\'environment\'\'\'.\n\n== Creating an Environment\n\nA new Trac environment is created using [TracAdmin#initenv trac-admin\'s initenv]:\n{{{#!sh\n$ trac-admin /path/to/myproject initenv\n}}}\n\n`trac-admin` will ask you for the name of the project and the database connection string, see below.\n\n=== Useful Tips\n\n - Place your environment\'s directory on a filesystem which supports sub-second timestamps, as Trac monitors the timestamp of its configuration files and changes happening on a filesystem with too coarse-grained timestamp resolution may go undetected in Trac < 1.0.2. This is also true for the location of authentication files when using TracStandalone.\n\n - The user under which the web server runs will require file system write permission to the environment directory and all the files inside. Please remember to set the appropriate permissions. The same applies to the source code repository, although the user under which Trac runs will only require write access to a Subversion repository created with the BDB file system; for other repository types, check the corresponding plugin\'s documentation. \n \n - `initenv` does not create a version control repository for the specified path. If you wish to specify a default repository using optional the arguments to `initenv` you must create the repository first, otherwise you will see a message when initializing the environment: //Warning: couldn\'t index the default repository//.\n\n - Non-ascii environment paths are not supported.\n\n - TracPlugins located in a [TracIni#inherit-section shared plugins folder] that is defined in an [TracIni#GlobalConfiguration inherited configuration] are currently not loaded during creation, and hence, if they need to create extra tables for example, you\'ll need to [TracUpgrade#UpgradetheTracEnvironment upgrade the environment].\n\n{{{#!div style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n**Caveat:** don\'t confuse the //Trac environment directory// with the //source code repository directory//.\n\nThis is a common beginners\' mistake.\nIt happens that the structure for a Trac environment is loosely modelled after the Subversion repository directory structure, but those are two disjoint entities and they are not and \'\'must not\'\' be located at the same place.\n}}}\n\n== Database Connection Strings\n\nTrac supports [http://sqlite.org/ SQLite], [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL] and [http://mysql.com/ MySQL] database backends. The default is SQLite, which is probably sufficient for most projects. The database file is then stored in the environment directory, and can easily be [wiki:TracBackup backed up] together with the rest of the environment.\n\nNote that if the username or password of the connection string (if applicable) contains the `:`, `/` or `@` characters, they need to be URL encoded.\n\n=== SQLite Connection String\n\nThe connection string for an SQLite database is:\n{{{\nsqlite:db/trac.db\n}}}\nwhere `db/trac.db` is the path to the database file within the Trac environment.\n\n=== PostgreSQL Connection String\n\nIf you want to use PostgreSQL instead, you\'ll have to use a different connection string. For example, to connect to a PostgreSQL database on the same machine called `trac` for user `johndoe` with the password `letmein` use:\n{{{\npostgres://johndoe:letmein@localhost/trac\n}}}\n\nIf PostgreSQL is running on a non-standard port, for example 9342, use:\n{{{\npostgres://johndoe:letmein@localhost:9342/trac\n}}}\n\nOn UNIX, you might want to select a UNIX socket for the transport, either the default socket as defined by the PGHOST environment variable:\n{{{\npostgres://user:password@/database\n}}}\n\nor a specific one:\n{{{\npostgres://user:password@/database?host=/path/to/socket/dir\n}}}\n\nNote that with PostgreSQL you will have to create the database before running `trac-admin initenv`.\n\nSee the [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/ PostgreSQL documentation] for detailed instructions on how to administer [http://postgresql.org PostgreSQL].\nGenerally, the following is sufficient to create a database user named `tracuser` and a database named `trac`:\n{{{#!sh\n$ createuser -U postgres -E -P tracuser\n$ createdb -U postgres -O tracuser -E UTF8 trac\n}}}\n\nWhen running `createuser` you will be prompted for the password for the user \'tracuser\'. This new user will not be a superuser, will not be allowed to create other databases and will not be allowed to create other roles. These privileges are not needed to run a Trac instance. If no password is desired for the user, simply remove the `-P` and `-E` options from the `createuser` command. Also note that the database should be created as UTF8. LATIN1 encoding causes errors, because of Trac\'s use of unicode. SQL_ASCII also seems to work.\n\nUnder some default configurations (Debian), run the `createuser` and `createdb` scripts as the `postgres` user:\n{{{#!sh\n$ sudo su - postgres -c \'createuser -U postgres -S -D -R -E -P tracuser\'\n$ sudo su - postgres -c \'createdb -U postgres -O tracuser -E UTF8 trac\'\n}}}\n\nTrac uses the `public` schema by default, but you can specify a different schema in the connection string:\n{{{\npostgres://user:pass@server/database?schema=yourschemaname\n}}}\n\n=== MySQL Connection String\n\nThe format of the MySQL connection string is similar to those for PostgreSQL, with the `postgres` scheme being replaced by `mysql`. For example, to connect to a MySQL database on the same machine called `trac` for user `johndoe` with password `letmein`:\n{{{\nmysql://johndoe:letmein@localhost:3306/trac\n}}}\n\n== Source Code Repository\n\nSince Trac 0.12, a single environment can be connected to more than one repository. There are many different ways to connect repositories to an environment, see TracRepositoryAdmin. This page also details the various attributes that can be set for a repository, such as `type`, `url`, `description`.\n\nIn Trac 0.12 `trac-admin` no longer asks questions related to repositories. Therefore, by default Trac is not connected to any source code repository, and the \'\'Browse Source\'\' toolbar item will not be displayed.\nYou can also explicitly disable the `trac.versioncontrol.*` components, which are otherwise still loaded:\n{{{#!ini\n[components]\ntrac.versioncontrol.* = disabled\n}}}\n\nFor some version control systems, it is possible to specify not only the path to the repository, but also a \'\'scope\'\' within the repository. Trac will then only show information related to the files and changesets below that scope. The Subversion backend for Trac supports this. For other types, check the corresponding plugin\'s documentation.\n\nExample of a configuration for a Subversion repository used as the default repository:\n{{{#!ini\n[trac]\nrepository_type = svn\nrepository_dir = /path/to/your/repository\n}}}\n\nThe configuration for a scoped Subversion repository would be:\n{{{#!ini\n[trac]\nrepository_type = svn\nrepository_dir = /path/to/your/repository/scope/within/repos\n}}}\n\n== Directory Structure\n\nAn environment directory will usually consist of the following files and directories:\n\n * `README` - Brief description of the environment.\n * `VERSION` - Environment version identifier.\n * `files`\n  * `attachments` - Attachments to wiki pages and tickets.\n * `conf`\n  * `trac.ini` - Main configuration file. See TracIni.\n * `db`\n  * `trac.db` - The SQLite database, if you are using SQLite.\n * `htdocs` - Directory containing web resources, which can be referenced in Genshi templates using `/chrome/site/...` URLs.\n * `log` - Default directory for log files, if `file` logging is enabled and a relative path is given.\n * `plugins` - Environment-specific [wiki:TracPlugins plugins].\n * `templates` - Custom Genshi environment-specific templates.\n  * `site.html` - Method to customize header, footer, and style, described in TracInterfaceCustomization#SiteAppearance.\n\n----\nSee also: TracAdmin, TracBackup, TracIni, TracGuide',NULL,NULL),('TracFastCgi',1,1629200947669098,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac with FastCGI\n\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n[[PageOutline(2-5, Contents, floated)]]\n\n[http://www.fastcgi.com/ FastCGI] interface allows Trac to remain resident much like with [wiki:TracModPython mod_python] or [wiki:TracModWSGI mod_wsgi]. It is faster than external CGI interfaces which must start a new process for each request. Additionally, it is supported by a much wider variety of web servers.\n\nNote that unlike mod_python, FastCGI supports [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html Apache SuEXEC], ie run with different permissions than the web server runs with. `mod_wsgi` supports the `WSGIDaemonProcess` with user / group parameters to achieve the same effect.\n\n\'\'\'Note for Windows:\'\'\' Trac\'s FastCGI does not run under Windows, as Windows does not implement `Socket.fromfd`, which is used by `_fcgi.py`. If you want to connect to IIS, you may want to try [trac:TracOnWindowsIisAjp AJP]/[trac:TracOnWindowsIisAjp ISAPI].\n\n== Apache configuration\n\nThere are two FastCGI modules commonly available for Apache: `mod_fastcgi` and `mod_fcgid` (preferred). The latter is more up-to-date.\n\nThe following sections focus on the FCGI specific setup, see also [wiki:TracModWSGI#ConfiguringAuthentication] for configuring the authentication in Apache.\n\nRegardless of which cgi module is used, be sure the web server has executable permissions on the cgi-bin folder. While FastCGI will throw specific permissions errors, mod_fcgid will throw an ambiguous error if this has not been done: `Connection reset by peer: mod_fcgid: error reading data from FastCGI server`.\n\n=== Set up with `mod_fastcgi`\n\n`mod_fastcgi` uses `FastCgiIpcDir` and `FastCgiConfig` directives that should be added to an appropriate Apache configuration file:\n{{{#!apache\n# Enable fastcgi for .fcgi files\n# (If you\'re using a distro package for mod_fcgi, something like\n# this is probably already present)\n<IfModule mod_fastcgi.c>\n   AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\n   FastCgiIpcDir /var/lib/apache2/fastcgi \n</IfModule>\nLoadModule fastcgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_fastcgi.so\n}}}\n\nSetting `FastCgiIpcDir` is optional if the default is suitable. Note that the `LoadModule` line must be after the `IfModule` group.\n\nConfigure `ScriptAlias` or similar options as described in TracCgi, but calling `trac.fcgi` instead of `trac.cgi`.\n\nAdd the following to the Apache configuration file (below the `FastCgiIpcDir` line) if you intend to set up the `TRAC_ENV` as an overall default:\n{{{#!apache\nFastCgiConfig -initial-env TRAC_ENV=/path/to/env/trac\n}}}\n\nAlternatively, you can serve multiple Trac projects in a directory by adding this:\n{{{#!apache\nFastCgiConfig -initial-env TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR=/parent/dir/of/projects\n}}}\n\n=== Set up with `mod_fcgid`\n\nConfigure `ScriptAlias` (see TracCgi for details), but call `trac.fcgi` instead of `trac.cgi`:\n{{{#!apache\nScriptAlias /trac /path/to/www/trac/cgi-bin/trac.fcgi/\n}}}\n\nNote the slash at the end.\n\nTo set up Trac environment for `mod_fcgid` it is necessary to use `DefaultInitEnv` directive. It cannot be used in `Directory` or `Location` context, so if you need to support multiple projects, try the alternative environment setup below:\n{{{#!apache\nDefaultInitEnv TRAC_ENV /path/to/env/trac/\n}}}\n\n=== Alternative environment setup\n\nA better method to specify the path to the Trac environment is to embed the path into `trac.fcgi` script itself. That doesn\'t require configuration of the server environment variables, works for both [trac:FastCgi] modules as well as for [http://www.lighttpd.net/ lighttpd] and CGI:\n{{{#!python\nimport os\nos.environ[\'TRAC_ENV\'] = \"/path/to/projectenv\"\n}}}\n\nor:\n{{{#!python\nimport os\nos.environ[\'TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR\'] = \"/path/to/project/parent/dir\"\n}}}\n\nWith this method different projects can be supported by using different `.fcgi` scripts with different `ScriptAliases`.\n\nSee [https://coderanger.net/~coderanger/httpd/fcgi_example.conf this fcgid example config] which uses a !ScriptAlias directive with trac.fcgi with a trailing / like this:\n{{{#!apache\nScriptAlias / /srv/tracsite/cgi-bin/trac.fcgi/\n}}}\n\n== Cherokee Configuration\n\nConfiguring [http://cherokee-project.com/ Cherokee] with Trac is straightforward, if you spawn Trac as an SCGI process. You can either start it manually, or better yet, automatically by letting Cherokee spawn the server whenever it is down.\n\nFirst set up an information source in cherokee-admin with a local interpreter:\n\n{{{\nHost:\nlocalhost:4433\n\nInterpreter:\n/usr/bin/tracd —single-env —daemonize —protocol=scgi —hostname=localhost —port=4433 /path/to/project/\n}}}\n\nIf the port was not reachable, the interpreter command would be launched. Note that, in the definition of the information source, you will have to manually launch the spawner if you use a \'\'Remote host\'\' as \'\'Information source\'\' instead of a \'\'Local interpreter\'\'.\n\nAfter doing this, we will just have to create a new rule managed by the SCGI handler to access Trac. It can be created in a new virtual server, trac.example.net for instance, and will only need two rules. The \'\'\'default\'\'\' one will use the SCGI handler associated to the previously created information source.\nThe second rule will be there to serve the few static files needed to correctly display the Trac interface. Create it as \'\'Directory rule\'\' for \'\'/common\'\' and just set it to the \'\'Static files\'\' handler and with a \'\'Document root\'\' that points to the appropriate files: \'\'$TRAC_LOCAL/htdocs/\'\' (where $TRAC_LOCAL is a directory defined by the user or the system administrator to place local Trac resources).\n\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' If the tracd process fails to start up, and Cherokee displays a 503 error page, you might be missing the [http://trac.saddi.com/flup python-flup] package ([trac:#9903]). Python-flup is a dependency which provides Trac with SCGI capability. You can install it on Debian based systems with:\n{{{#!sh\nsudo apt-get install python-flup\n}}}\n\n== Lighttpd Configuration\n\nThe FastCGI front-end was developed primarily for use with alternative webservers, such as [http://www.lighttpd.net/ Lighttpd].\n\nLighttpd is a secure, fast, compliant and very flexible web-server that has been optimized for high-performance environments. It has a very low memory footprint compared to other web servers and takes care of CPU load.\n\nFor using `trac.fcgi`(prior to 0.11) / fcgi_frontend.py (0.11) with Lighttpd add the following to your lighttpd.conf:\n{{{\n#var.fcgi_binary=\"/usr/bin/python /path/to/fcgi_frontend.py\" # 0.11 if installed with easy_setup, it is inside the egg directory\nvar.fcgi_binary=\"/path/to/cgi-bin/trac.fcgi\" # 0.10 name of prior fcgi executable\nfastcgi.server = (\"/trac\" =>\n   \n                   (\"trac\" =>\n                     (\"socket\" => \"/tmp/trac-fastcgi.sock\",\n                      \"bin-path\" => fcgi_binary,\n                      \"check-local\" => \"disable\",\n                      \"bin-environment\" =>\n                        (\"TRAC_ENV\" => \"/path/to/projenv\")\n                     )\n                   )\n                 )\n}}}\n\nNote that you will need to add a new entry to `fastcgi.server` for each separate Trac instance that you wish to run. Alternatively, you may use the `TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR` variable instead of `TRAC_ENV` as described above, and you may set one of the two in `trac.fcgi` instead of in `lighttpd.conf` using `bin-environment`, as in the section above on Apache configuration.\n\nNote that Lighttpd has a bug related to \'SCRIPT_NAME\' and \'PATH_INFO\' when the uri of fastcgi.server is \'/\' instead of \'/trac\' in this example (see [trac:#2418]). This is fixed in Lighttpd 1.5, and under Lighttpd 1.4.23 or later the workaround is to add `\"fix-root-scriptname\" => \"enable\"` as a parameter of fastcgi.server.\n\nFor using two projects with lighttpd add the following to your `lighttpd.conf`:\n{{{\nfastcgi.server = (\"/first\" =>\n                   (\"first\" =>\n                    (\"socket\" => \"/tmp/trac-fastcgi-first.sock\",\n                     \"bin-path\" => fcgi_binary,\n                     \"check-local\" => \"disable\",\n                     \"bin-environment\" =>\n                       (\"TRAC_ENV\" => \"/path/to/projenv-first\")\n                    )\n                  ),\n                  \"/second\" =>\n                    (\"second\" =>\n                    (\"socket\" => \"/tmp/trac-fastcgi-second.sock\",\n                     \"bin-path\" => fcgi_binary,\n                     \"check-local\" => \"disable\",\n                     \"bin-environment\" =>\n                       (\"TRAC_ENV\" => \"/path/to/projenv-second\")\n                    )\n                  )\n                )\n}}}\n\nNote that the field values are different. If you prefer setting the environment variables in the `.fcgi` scripts, then copy/rename `trac.fcgi`, eg to `first.fcgi` and `second.fcgi`, and reference them in the above settings.\nNote that the above will result in different processes in any event, even if both are running from the same `trac.fcgi` script.\n\n{{{#!div class=important\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' The order in which the server.modules are loaded is very important: if mod_auth is not loaded \'\'\'before\'\'\' mod_fastcgi, then the server will fail to authenticate the user.\n}}}\n\nFor authentication you should enable mod_auth in lighttpd.conf \'server.modules\', select auth.backend and auth rules:\n{{{\nserver.modules              = (\n...\n  \"mod_auth\",\n...\n)\n\nauth.backend               = \"htpasswd\"\n\n# Separated password files for each project\n# See \"Conditional Configuration\" in\n# http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/file/branches/lighttpd-merge-1.4.x/doc/configuration.txt\n\n$HTTP[\"url\"] =~ \"^/first/\" {\n  auth.backend.htpasswd.userfile = \"/path/to/projenv-first/htpasswd.htaccess\"\n}\n$HTTP[\"url\"] =~ \"^/second/\" {\n  auth.backend.htpasswd.userfile = \"/path/to/projenv-second/htpasswd.htaccess\"\n}\n\n# Enable auth on trac URLs, see\n# http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/file/branches/lighttpd-merge-1.4.x/doc/authentication.txt\n\nauth.require = (\"/first/login\" =>\n                (\"method\"  => \"basic\",\n                 \"realm\"   => \"First project\",\n                 \"require\" => \"valid-user\"\n                ),\n                \"/second/login\" =>\n                (\"method\"  => \"basic\",\n                 \"realm\"   => \"Second project\",\n                 \"require\" => \"valid-user\"\n                )\n               )\n\n}}}\n\nNote that Lighttpd (v1.4.3) stops if the password file doesn\'t exist.\n\nNote that Lighttpd doesn\'t support \'valid-user\' in versions prior to 1.3.16.\n\nConditional configuration is also useful for mapping static resources, ie serving out images and CSS directly instead of through FastCGI:\n{{{\n# Aliasing functionality is needed\nserver.modules += (\"mod_alias\")\n\n# Set up an alias for the static resources\nalias.url = (\"/trac/chrome/common\" => \"/usr/share/trac/htdocs\")\n\n# Use negative lookahead, matching all requests that ask for any resource under /trac, EXCEPT in\n# /trac/chrome/common, and use FastCGI for those\n$HTTP[\"url\"] =~ \"^/trac(?!/chrome/common)\" {\n# Even if you have other fastcgi.server declarations for applications other than Trac, do NOT use += here\nfastcgi.server = (\"/trac\" =>\n                   (\"trac\" =>\n                     (\"socket\" => \"/tmp/trac-fastcgi.sock\",\n                      \"bin-path\" => fcgi_binary,\n                      \"check-local\" => \"disable\",\n                      \"bin-environment\" =>\n                        (\"TRAC_ENV\" => \"/path/to/projenv\")\n                     )\n                   )\n                 )\n}\n}}}\n\nThe technique can be easily adapted for use with multiple projects by creating aliases for each of them, and wrapping the fastcgi.server declarations inside conditional configuration blocks.\n\nAlso there is another way to handle multiple projects and it uses `TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR` instead of `TRAC_ENV` as well as global authentication:\n{{{\n#  This is for handling multiple projects\n  alias.url       = ( \"/trac/\" => \"/path/to/trac/htdocs/\" )\n\n  fastcgi.server += (\"/projects\"  =>\n                      (\"trac\" =>\n                        (\n                          \"socket\" => \"/tmp/trac.sock\",\n                          \"bin-path\" => fcgi_binary,\n                          \"check-local\" => \"disable\",\n                          \"bin-environment\" =>\n                            (\"TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR\" => \"/path/to/parent/dir/of/projects/\" )\n                        )\n                      )\n                    )\n#And here starts the global auth configuration\n  auth.backend = \"htpasswd\"\n  auth.backend.htpasswd.userfile = \"/path/to/unique/htpassword/file/trac.htpasswd\"\n  $HTTP[\"url\"] =~ \"^/projects/.*/login$\" {\n    auth.require = (\"/\" =>\n                     (\n                       \"method\"  => \"basic\",\n                       \"realm\"   => \"trac\",\n                       \"require\" => \"valid-user\"\n                     )\n                   )\n  }\n}}}\n\nChanging date/time format also supported by lighttpd over environment variable LC_TIME:\n{{{\nfastcgi.server = (\"/trac\" =>\n                   (\"trac\" =>\n                     (\"socket\" => \"/tmp/trac-fastcgi.sock\",\n                      \"bin-path\" => fcgi_binary,\n                      \"check-local\" => \"disable\",\n                      \"bin-environment\" =>\n                        (\"TRAC_ENV\" => \"/path/to/projenv\",\n                        \"LC_TIME\" => \"ru_RU\")\n                     )\n                   )\n                 )\n}}}\n\nFor details about languages specification see [trac:TracFaq TracFaq] question 2.13.\n\nOther important information like the [wiki:TracInstall#MappingStaticResources mapping static resources advices] are useful for non-fastcgi specific installation aspects.\n\nRelaunch Lighttpd and browse to `http://yourhost.example.org/trac` to access Trac.\n\nNote about running Lighttpd with reduced permissions: If nothing else helps and trac.fcgi doesn\'t start with Lighttpd settings `server.username = \"www-data\"`, `server.groupname = \"www-data\"`, then in the `bin-environment` section set `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` to the home directory of `www-data` or some other directory accessible to this account for writing.\n\n== !LiteSpeed Configuration\n\nThe FastCGI front-end was developed primarily for use with alternative webservers, such as [http://www.litespeedtech.com/ LiteSpeed].\n\n!LiteSpeed web server is an event-driven asynchronous Apache replacement designed from the ground-up to be secure, scalable, and operate with minimal resources. !LiteSpeed can operate directly from an Apache config file and is targeted for business-critical environments.\n\n 1. Please make sure you have a working install of a Trac project. Test install with \"tracd\" first.\n 1. Create a Virtual Host for this setup. From now on we will refer to this vhost as !TracVhost. For this tutorial we will be assuming that your Trac project will be accessible via:\n{{{\nhttp://yourdomain.com/trac/\n}}}\n 1. Go \"!TracVhost → External Apps\" tab and create a new \"External Application\":\n{{{\nName: MyTracFCGI	\nAddress: uds://tmp/lshttpd/mytracfcgi.sock\nMax Connections: 10\nEnvironment: TRAC_ENV=/fullpathto/mytracproject/ <--- path to root folder of trac project\nInitial Request Timeout (secs): 30\nRetry Timeout (secs): 0\nPersistent Connection	Yes\nConnection Keepalive Timeout: 30\nResponse Bufferring: No	\nAuto Start: Yes\nCommand: /usr/share/trac/cgi-bin/trac.fcgi  <--- path to trac.fcgi\nBack Log: 50\nInstances: 10\n}}}\n 1. Optional: If you need to use htpasswd based authentication. Go to \"!TracVhost → Security\" tab and create a new security Realm:\n {{{\nDB Type: Password File\nRealm Name: MyTracUserDB               <--- any name you wish and referenced later\nUser DB Location: /fullpathto/htpasswd <--- path to your htpasswd file\n}}}\n If you don’t have a htpasswd file or don’t know how to create the entries within one, go to http://sherylcanter.com/encrypt.php, to generate the user:password combos.\n 1.

Reload nginx and launch trac.fcgi: \n {{{#!sh\ntrac@trac.example ~ $ ./trac-standalone-fcgi.py \n}}}\n\nThe above assumes that:\n * There is a user named \'trac\' for running Trac instances and keeping Trac environments in its home directory\n * `/home/trac/instance` contains a Trac environment\n * `/home/trac/htpasswd` contains authentication information\n * `/home/trac/run` is owned by the same group the Nginx runs under\n  * and if your system is Linux the `/home/trac/run` has setgid bit set (`chmod g+s run`)\n  * and patch from [trac:#7239] is applied, or you\'ll have to fix the socket file permissions every time\n\nUnfortunately Nginx does not support variable expansion in fastcgi_pass directive. \nThus it is not possible to serve multiple Trac instances from one server block. \n\nIf you worry enough about security, run Trac instances under separate users. \n\nAnother way to run Trac as a FCGI external application is offered in [trac:#6224].\n\n----\nSee also: TracGuide, TracInstall, [wiki:TracModWSGI ModWSGI], [wiki:TracCgi CGI], [wiki:TracModPython ModPython], [trac:TracNginxRecipe TracNginxRecipe]\n',NULL,NULL),('TracFineGrainedPermissions',1,1629200947718344,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Fine grained permissions =\n[[PageOutline(2-5, Contents, floated)]]\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nThere is a general mechanism in place that allows custom **permission policy plugins** to grant or deny any action on any kind of Trac resource, even at the level of specific versions of such resources.\n\nThat mechanism is `authz_policy`, which is an optional module in `tracopt.perm.authz_policy.*`, so it is installed by default. It can be activated via the //Plugins// panel in the Trac administration module.\n\n== Permission Policies ==\n\nA great diversity of permission policies can be implemented and Trac comes with a few examples. \n\nWhich policies are currently active is determined by a configuration setting in TracIni:\n\n{{{#!ini\n[trac]\npermission_policies = AuthzSourcePolicy, DefaultPermissionPolicy, LegacyAttachmentPolicy\n}}}\nThis lists the [#AuthzSourcePolicy] described below as the first policy, followed by the !DefaultPermissionPolicy which checks for the traditional coarse grained style permissions described in TracPermissions, and the !LegacyAttachmentPolicy which knows how to use the coarse grained permissions for checking the permissions available on attachments.\n\nAmong the optional choices, there is [#AuthzPolicy], a very generic permission policy, based on an Authz-style system. See\n[trac:source:branches/1.0-stable/tracopt/perm/authz_policy.py authz_policy.py] for details. \n\nAnother popular permission policy [#AuthzSourcePolicy], re-implements the pre-0.12 support for checking fine-grained permissions limited to Subversion repositories in terms of the new system.\n\nSee also [trac:source:branches/1.0-stable/sample-plugins/permissions sample-plugins/permissions] for more examples.\n\n=== !AuthzPolicy === \n==== Configuration ====\n* Install [http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html ConfigObj].\n* Put a [http://swapoff.org/files/authzpolicy.conf authzpolicy.conf] file somewhere, preferably on a secured location on the server, not readable for others than the webuser. If the  file contains non-ASCII characters, the UTF-8 encoding should be used.\n* Update your `trac.ini`:\n  1. modify the [TracIni#trac-section permission_policies] entry in the `[trac]` section:\n{{{#!ini\n[trac]\n...\npermission_policies = AuthzPolicy, DefaultPermissionPolicy, LegacyAttachmentPolicy\n}}}\n  1. add a new `[authz_policy]` section:\n{{{#!ini\n[authz_policy]\nauthz_file = /some/trac/env/conf/authzpolicy.conf\n}}}\n  1. enable the plugin through [/admin/general/plugin WebAdmin] or by editing the `[components]` section:\n{{{#!ini\n[components]\ntracopt.perm.authz_policy.* = enabled\n}}}\n\n==== Usage Notes ====\n\nNote the order in which permission policies are specified: policies are implemented in the sequence provided and therefore may override earlier policy specifications.\n\nA policy will return either `True`, `False` or `None` for a given permission check. `True` is returned if the policy explicitly grants the permission. `False` is returned if the policy explicitly denies the permission. `None` is returned if the policy is unable to either grant or deny the permission.\n\nNOTE: Only if the return value is `None` will the \'\'next\'\' permission policy be consulted. If none of the policies explicitly grants the permission, the final result will be `False`, i.e. permission denied.\n\nThe `authzpolicy.conf` file is a `.ini` style configuration file:\n{{{#!ini\n[wiki:PrivatePage@*]\njohn = WIKI_VIEW, !WIKI_MODIFY\njack = WIKI_VIEW\n* =\n}}}\n* Each section of the config is a glob pattern used to match against a Trac resource descriptor. These descriptors are in the form:\n{{{\n<realm>:<id>@<version>[/<realm>:<id>@<version> ...]\n}}}\n\nResources are ordered left to right, from parent to child. If any component is inapplicable, `*` is substituted. If the version pattern is not specified explicitly, all versions (`@*`) is added implicitly. Example: Match the WikiStart page:\n{{{#!ini\n[wiki:*]\n[wiki:WikiStart*]\n[wiki:WikiStart@*]\n[wiki:WikiStart]\n}}}\n\nExample: Match the attachment `wiki:WikiStart@117/attachment:FOO.JPG@*` on WikiStart:\n{{{#!ini\n[wiki:*]\n[wiki:WikiStart*]\n[wiki:WikiStart@*]\n[wiki:WikiStart@*/attachment:*]\n[wiki:WikiStart@117/attachment:FOO.JPG]\n}}}\n\n* Sections are checked against the current Trac resource descriptor \'\'\'IN ORDER\'\'\' of appearance in the configuration file. \'\'\'ORDER IS CRITICAL\'\'\'.\n\n* Once a section matches, the current username is matched against the keys (usernames) of the section, \'\'\'IN ORDER\'\'\'. \n  * If a key (username) is prefixed with a `@`, it is treated as a group. \n  * If a value (permission) is prefixed with a `!`, the permission is denied rather than granted.\n\nThe username will match any of \'anonymous\', \'authenticated\', <username> or \'*\', using normal Trac permission rules. || \'\'\'Note:\'\'\' Other groups which are created by user (e.g. by \'adding subjects to groups\' on web interface page //Admin / Permissions//) cannot be used. See [trac:ticket:5648 #5648] for details about this missing feature. ||\n\nFor example, if the `authz_file` contains:\n{{{#!ini\n[wiki:WikiStart@*]\n* = WIKI_VIEW\n\n[wiki:PrivatePage@*]\njohn = WIKI_VIEW\n* = !WIKI_VIEW\n}}}\nand the default permissions are set like this:\n{{{\njohn           WIKI_VIEW\njack           WIKI_VIEW\n# anonymous has no WIKI_VIEW\n}}}\n\nThen: \n  * All versions of WikiStart will be viewable by everybody, including anonymous\n  * !PrivatePage will be viewable only by john\n  * other pages will be viewable only by john and jack\n\nGroups:\n{{{#!ini\n[groups]\nadmins = john, jack\ndevs = alice, bob\n\n[wiki:Dev@*]\n@admins = TRAC_ADMIN\n@devs = WIKI_VIEW\n* =\n\n[*]\n@admins = TRAC_ADMIN\n* =\n}}}\n\nThen:\n- everything is blocked (whitelist approach), but\n- admins get all TRAC_ADMIN everywhere and\n- devs can view wiki pages.\n\nSome repository examples (Browse Source specific):\n{{{#!ini\n# A single repository:\n[repository:test_repo@*]\njohn = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW\n# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW for the entire test_repo\n\n# The default repository (requires Trac 1.0.2 or later):\n[repository:@*]\njohn = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW\n# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW for the entire default repository\n\n# All repositories:\n[repository:*@*]\njack = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW\n# Jack has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW for all repositories\n}}}\n\nVery granular repository access:\n{{{#!ini\n# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW access to trunk/src/some/location/ only\n[repository:test_repo@*/source:trunk/src/some/location/*@*]\njohn = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW\n\n# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW access to only revision 1 of all files at trunk/src/some/location only\n[repository:test_repo@*/source:trunk/src/some/location/*@1]\njohn = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW\n\n# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW access to all revisions of \'somefile\' at trunk/src/some/location only \n[repository:test_repo@*/source:trunk/src/some/location/somefile@*]\njohn = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW\n\n# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW access to only revision 1 of \'somefile\' at trunk/src/some/location only\n[repository:test_repo@*/source:trunk/src/some/location/somefile@1]\njohn = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW\n}}}\n\nNote: In order for Timeline to work/visible for John, we must add CHANGESET_VIEW to the above permission list.\n\n==== Missing Features ====\nAlthough possible with the !DefaultPermissionPolicy handling (see Admin panel), fine-grained permissions still miss those grouping features (see [trac:ticket:9573 #9573], [trac:ticket:5648 #5648]). Patches are partially available, see authz_policy.2.patch, part of [trac:ticket:6680 #6680].\n\nYou cannot do the following:\n{{{#!ini\n[groups]\nteam1 = a, b, c\nteam2 = d, e, f\nteam3 = g, h, i\ndepartmentA = team1, team2\n}}}\n\nPermission groups are not supported either, so you cannot do the following:\n{{{#!ini\n[groups]\npermission_level_1 = WIKI_VIEW, TICKET_VIEW\npermission_level_2  = permission_level_1, WIKI_MODIFY, TICKET_MODIFY\n[*]\n@team1 = permission_level_1\n@team2 = permission_level_2\n@team3 = permission_level_2, TICKET_CREATE\n}}}\n\n=== !AuthzSourcePolicy  (mod_authz_svn-like permission policy) === #AuthzSourcePolicy\n\nAt the time of this writing, the old granular permissions system from Trac 0.11 and before used for restricting access to the repository has been converted to a permission policy component. But from the user\'s point of view, this makes little if any difference.\n\nThat kind of granular permission control needs a definition file, which is the one used by Subversion\'s mod_authz_svn. \nMore information about this file format and about its usage in Subversion is available in the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.html Path-Based Authorization] section in the Server Configuration chapter of the svn book.\n\nExample:\n{{{#!ini\n[/]\n* = r\n\n[/branches/calc/bug-142]\nharry = rw\nsally = r\n\n[/branches/calc/bug-142/secret]\nharry =\n}}}\n\n * \'\'\'/\'\'\' = \'\'Everyone has read access by default\'\'\n * \'\'\'/branches/calc/bug-142\'\'\' = \'\'harry has read/write access, sally read only\'\'\n * \'\'\'/branches/calc/bug-142/secret\'\'\' = \'\'harry has no access, sally has read access (inherited as a sub folder permission)\'\'\n\n==== Trac Configuration ====\n\nTo activate granular permissions you __must__ specify the {{{authz_file}}} option in the {{{[trac]}}} section of trac.ini. If this option is set to null or not specified, the permissions will not be used.\n\n{{{#!ini\n[trac]\nauthz_file = /path/to/svnaccessfile\n}}}\n\nIf you want to support the use of the `[`\'\'modulename\'\'`:/`\'\'some\'\'`/`\'\'path\'\'`]` syntax within the `authz_file`, add:\n\n{{{#!ini\nauthz_module_name = modulename\n}}}\n\nwhere \'\'modulename\'\' refers to the same repository indicated by the `repository_dir` entry in the `[trac]` section. As an example, if the `repository_dir` entry in the `[trac]` section is {{{/srv/active/svn/somemodule}}}, that would yield the following:\n\n{{{ #!ini\n[trac]\nauthz_file = /path/to/svnaccessfile\nauthz_module_name = somemodule\n...\nrepository_dir = /srv/active/svn/somemodule \n}}}\n\nwhere the svn access file, {{{/path/to/svnaccessfile}}}, contains entries such as {{{[somemodule:/some/path]}}}.\n\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' Usernames inside the Authz file __must__ be the same as those used inside trac. \n\nAs of version 0.12, make sure you have \'\'!AuthzSourcePolicy\'\' included in the permission_policies list in trac.ini, otherwise the authz permissions file will be ignored.\n\n{{{#!ini\n[trac]\npermission_policies = AuthzSourcePolicy, DefaultPermissionPolicy, LegacyAttachmentPolicy\n}}}\n\n==== Subversion Configuration ====\n\nThe same access file is typically applied to the corresponding Subversion repository using an Apache directive like this:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /repos>\n  DAV svn\n  SVNParentPath /usr/local/svn\n\n  # our access control policy\n  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/svnaccessfile\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nFor information about how to restrict access to entire projects in a multiple project environment see [trac:wiki:TracMultipleProjectsSVNAccess].\n\n== Debugging permissions\nIn trac.ini set:\n{{{#!ini\n[logging]\nlog_file = trac.log\nlog_level = DEBUG\nlog_type = file\n}}}\n\nDisplay the trac.log to understand what checks are being performed:\n{{{#!sh\ntail -n 0 -f log/trac.log | egrep \'\\[perm\\]|\\[authz_policy\\]\'\n}}}\n\nSee the sourced documentation of the plugin for more info.\n\n----\nSee also: TracPermissions,\n[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/FineGrainedPageAuthzEditorPlugin TracHacks:FineGrainedPageAuthzEditorPlugin] for a simple editor plugin.',NULL,NULL),('TracGuide',1,1629200947632297,'trac','127.0.0.1','= The Trac User and Administration Guide\n\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n{{{#!span style=\"font-size:90%\"\n//The TracGuide is meant to serve as a starting point for all documentation regarding Trac usage and development.

Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project management. It helps developers write great software while staying out of the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a team\'s established development process and policies.\n\nIt provides an interface to Subversion as well as other version control systems, an integrated Wiki and convenient reporting facilities.\n\nTrac allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, creating links and seamless references between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and wiki pages. A timeline shows all current and past project events in order, making the acquisition of an overview of the project and tracking progress very easy. The roadmap shows the road ahead, listing the upcoming milestones.\n\n== User Guide\n\n   * Using the Wiki subsystem:\n     * TracWiki — How to use the built-in Wiki.\n     * WikiFormatting — Reference to the wiki syntax used throughout.\n   * Using the Version Control subsystem:\n     * TracBrowser — Browsing source code with Trac.\n     * TracChangeset — Viewing changes to source code.\n     * TracRevisionLog — Viewing change history.\n   * Using the Ticket subsystem:\n     * TracTickets — Using the issue tracker.\n     * TracRoadmap — The roadmap helps tracking project progress.\n     * TracReports — Writing and using reports.\n     * TracQuery — Executing custom ticket queries.\n     * TracBatchModify - Modifying a batch of tickets in one request.\n   * Other modules and general topics:\n     * TracSearch — Full text search in all content.\n     * TracTimeline — The timeline provides a historic perspective on a project.\n     * TracRss — RSS content syndication in Trac.\n     * TracAccessibility — Accessibility keys support.\n\n== Administrator Guide\n\n   * Installation and upgrade:\n     * TracInstall — How to install and run Trac.\n     * TracUpgrade — How to upgrade existing installations.\n     * TracImport — Importing tickets from other bug databases.\n     * TracPlugins — Installing and managing Trac extensions.\n   * Configuration and customization:\n     * TracIni — Trac configuration file reference. \n     * TracPermissions — Access control and permissions.\n     * TracNavigation — Customize main navigation menus.\n     * TracInterfaceCustomization — Customizing the Trac interface.\n     * TracLogging — The Trac logging facility.\n   * Administering the Version Control subsystem:\n     * TracRepositoryAdmin — Management of Source Code Repositories.\n   * Administering the Ticket subsystem:\n     * TracTicketsCustomFields — Expanding tickets with customized fields.\n     * TracNotification — Email notification.\n     * TracWorkflow — Configurable Ticket Workflow.\n   * Reference:\n     * TracEnvironment — All you need to know about Trac environments.\n     * TracAdmin — Administering a Trac project via the command-line.\n\n== Support and Other Sources of Information\n\n * [trac:TracFaq Trac FAQ] — A collection of Frequently Asked Questions on the project website.\n * [trac:TracDev] and [trac:TracDev/ApiDocs API docs] — Trac Developer documentation.\n * TracSupport — How to get more information.\n\nIf you are looking for a good place to ask a question about Trac, see the [trac:MailingList MailingList].

The `trac.ini` configuration file and its parent directory should be writable by the web server.\n\nTrac monitors the timestamp of the file to trigger a complete environment reload and flush its caches when the timestamp changes. Most changes to the configuration will be reflected immediately, though changes to the `[components]` or `[logging]` sections will require restarting the web server. You may also need to restart the web server after creating a [#GlobalConfiguration global configuration] file when none was previously present.\n\n== Global Configuration\n\nConfiguration can be shared among environments using one or more global configuration files. Options in the global configuration will be merged with the environment-specific options, with local options overriding global options. The global configuration file is specified as follows:\n{{{#!ini\n[inherit]\nfile = /path/to/global/trac.ini\n}}}\nMultiple files can be specified using a comma-separated list.\n\nNote that you can also specify a global option file when creating a new project, by adding the option `--inherit=/path/to/global/trac.ini` to [TracAdmin#initenv trac-admin]\'s `initenv` command. If you do not do this but nevertheless intend to use a global option file with your new environment, you will have to go through the newly generated `conf/trac.ini` file and delete the entries that will otherwise override those set in the global file.\n\nThere are two more entries in the [[#inherit-section| [inherit] ]] section, `templates_dir` for sharing global templates and `plugins_dir`, for sharing plugins. Those entries can themselves be specified in the shared configuration file, and in fact, configuration files can even be chained if you specify another `[inherit] file` there.\n\nNote that the templates found in the `templates/` directory of the TracEnvironment have precedence over those found in `[inherit] templates_dir`. In turn, the latter have precedence over the installed templates, so be careful about what you put there. Notably, if you override a default template, refresh your modifications when you upgrade to a new version of Trac. The preferred way to perform TracInterfaceCustomization is still to write a custom plugin doing an appropriate `ITemplateStreamFilter` transformation.\n\n== Reference for settings\n\nThis is a brief reference of available configuration options, and their default settings.\n\nDocumentation improvements should be discussed on the [trac:MailingList#Trac-dev trac-dev mailing list] or described in a [trac:NewTicket ticket]. Even better, [trac:TracDev/SubmittingPatches submit a patch] against the docstrings in the code.\n{{{ #!comment\nPlease don\'t waste your time by editing the HTML code below, changes won\'t be picked up. Instead, follow the above guidance for suggesting documentation improvements.\n}}}\n[[TracIni]]\n\n----\nSee also: TracGuide, TracAdmin, TracEnvironment\n',NULL,NULL),('TracInstall',1,1629200947601566,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac Installation Guide for 1.0\n\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nTrac is written in the Python programming language and needs a database, [http://sqlite.org/ SQLite], [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL], or [http://mysql.com/ MySQL]. For HTML rendering, Trac uses the [http://genshi.edgewall.org Genshi] templating system.\n\nSince version 0.12, Trac can also be localized, and there is probably a translation available in your language. If you want to use the Trac interface in other languages, then make sure you have installed the optional package [#OtherPythonPackages Babel]. Pay attention to the extra steps for localization support in the [#InstallingTrac Installing Trac] section below. Lacking Babel, you will only get the default English version.\n\nIf you\'re interested in contributing new translations for other languages or enhancing the existing translations, then please have a look at [trac:wiki:TracL10N TracL10N].\n\nWhat follows are generic instructions for installing and setting up Trac. While you may find instructions for installing Trac on specific systems at [trac:TracInstallPlatforms TracInstallPlatforms] on the main Trac site, please \'\'\'first read through these general instructions\'\'\' to get a good understanding of the tasks involved.\n\n[[PageOutline(2-3,Installation Steps,inline)]]\n\n== Dependencies\n\n=== Mandatory Dependencies\n\nTo install Trac, the following software packages must be installed:\n\n * [http://www.python.org/ Python], version >= 2.5 and < 3.0\n   (note that we dropped the support for Python 2.4 in this release)\n * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools setuptools], version >= 0.6\n * [http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Download Genshi], version >= 0.6\n\nYou also need a database system and the corresponding python bindings. The database can be either SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\n==== For the SQLite database #ForSQLite\n\nAs you must be using Python 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7, you already have the SQLite database bindings bundled with the standard distribution of Python: the `sqlite3` module.\n\nOptionally, you may install a newer version of [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysqlite pysqlite] than the one provided by the Python distribution. See [trac:PySqlite#ThePysqlite2bindings PySqlite] for details.\n\n==== For the PostgreSQL database #ForPostgreSQL\n\nYou need to install the database and its Python bindings:\n * [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL], version 8.0 or later\n * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2 psycopg2], version 2.0 or later\n\nSee [trac:DatabaseBackend#Postgresql DatabaseBackend] for details.\n\n==== For the MySQL database #ForMySQL\n\nTrac works well with MySQL, provided you follow the guidelines:\n\n * [http://mysql.com/ MySQL] or [http://mariadb.org/ MariaDB], version 5.0 or later\n * [http://sf.net/projects/mysql-python MySQLdb], version 1.2.2 or later\n\nGiven the caveats and known issues surrounding MySQL, read the [trac:MySqlDb] page before creating the database.\n\n=== Optional Dependencies\n\n==== Version Control System\n\n===== Subversion\n * [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion], 1.5.x or later and the \'\'\'corresponding\'\'\' Python bindings. Older versions starting from 1.0, like 1.2.4, 1.3.2 or 1.4.2, etc. may still work. For troubleshooting information, check the [trac:TracSubversion#Troubleshooting TracSubversion] page.\n\nThere are [http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html pre-compiled SWIG bindings] available for various platforms. (Good luck finding precompiled SWIG bindings for any Windows package at that listing. [trac:TracSubversion] points you to [http://alagazam.net Alagazam], which works for me under Python 2.6.)\n\nNote that Trac \'\'\'doesn\'t\'\'\' use [http://pysvn.tigris.org/ PySVN], neither does it work yet with the newer `ctype`-style bindings. \n\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' if using Subversion, Trac must be installed on the \'\'\'same machine\'\'\'. Remote repositories are currently [trac:ticket:493 not supported].\n\n===== Git\n * [http://git-scm.com/ Git] 1.5.6 or later.\n\nMore information is available on the [trac:TracGit] page.\n\n===== Others \n\nSupport for other version control systems is provided via third-parties. See [trac:PluginList#VersionControlSystems] and [trac:VersionControlSystem].\n\n==== Web Server\n\nA web server is optional because Trac has a server included, see the [#RunningtheStandaloneServer Running the Standalone Server] section below.\n\nAlternatively you can configure Trac to run in any of the following environments:\n * [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] with \n   - [http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/ mod_wsgi], see [wiki:TracModWSGI] and \n     http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/IntegrationWithTrac\n   - [http://modpython.org/ mod_python 3.5.0], see TracModPython\n * a [http://www.fastcgi.com/ FastCGI]-capable web server (see TracFastCgi)\n * an [http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/ajp/ajpv13a.html AJP]-capable web\n   server (see [trac:TracOnWindowsIisAjp TracOnWindowsIisAjp])\n * a FastCGI and FastCGI-to-WSGI gateway (see [trac:TracOnWindowsIisWfastcgi])\n * a CGI-capable web server (see TracCgi), but //usage of Trac as a cgi script \n   is highly discouraged//, better use one of the previous options. \n   \n==== Other Python Packages\n\n * [http://babel.edgewall.org Babel], version 0.9.5, 0.9.6 or >= 1.3\n   needed for localization support\n * [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ docutils], version >= 0.3.9 \n   for WikiRestructuredText.\n * [http://pygments.org Pygments] for \n   [TracSyntaxColoring syntax highlighting].\n   [http://silvercity.sourceforge.net/ SilverCity] and/or \n   [http://gnu.org/software/enscript/enscript.html Enscript] may still be used\n   but are deprecated and you really should be using Pygments.\n * [http://pytz.sf.net pytz] to get a complete list of time zones,\n   otherwise Trac will fall back on a shorter list from \n   an internal time zone implementation.\n\n{{{#!div style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n**Attention**: The available versions of these dependencies are not necessarily interchangeable, so please pay attention to the version numbers. If you are having trouble getting Trac to work, please double-check all the dependencies before asking for help on the [trac:MailingList] or [trac:IrcChannel].\n}}}\n\nPlease refer to the documentation of these packages to find out how they are best installed. In addition, most of the [trac:TracInstallPlatforms platform-specific instructions] also describe the installation of the dependencies. Keep in mind however that the information there probably concern older versions of Trac than the one you\'re installing.\n\n== Installing Trac\n\nThe [TracAdmin trac-admin] command-line tool, used to create and maintain [TracEnvironment project environments], as well as the [TracStandalone tracd] standalone server are installed along with Trac. There are several methods for installing Trac.\n\nIt is assumed throughout this guide that you have elevated permissions as the `root` user, or by prefixing commands with `sudo`. The umask `0022` should be used for a typical installation on a Unix-based platform.\n\n=== Using `easy_install`\n\nTrac can be installed from [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Trac PyPI] or the Subversion repository using [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools setuptools].\n\nA few command-line examples:\n\n - Install the latest stable version of Trac:\n {{{#!sh\n$ easy_install Trac\n}}}\n - Install latest development version:\n {{{#!sh\n$ easy_install http://download.edgewall.org/trac/Trac-latest-dev.tar.gz\n}}}\n   Note that in this case you won\'t have the possibility to run a localized version of Trac;\n   either use a released version or install from source.\n\nMore information can be found on the [trac:wiki:setuptools setuptools] page.\n\n{{{#!div style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n**Setuptools Warning:** If the version of your setuptools is in the range 5.4 through 5.6, the environment variable `PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS` must be set in order to avoid significant performance degradation. More information may be found in [#DeployingTrac Deploying Trac].\n}}}\n\n=== Using `pip`\n\n\'pip\' is an easy_install replacement that is very useful to quickly install Python packages.\nTo get a Trac installation up and running in less than 5 minutes:\n\nAssuming you want to have your entire pip installation in `/opt/user/trac`:\n\n - \n {{{#!sh\n$ pip install trac psycopg2 \n}}}\nor:\n - \n {{{#!sh\n$ pip install trac mysql-python \n}}}\n\nMake sure your OS specific headers are available for pip to automatically build PostgreSQL (`libpq-dev`) or MySQL (`libmysqlclient-dev`) bindings.\n\npip will automatically resolve all dependencies (like Genshi, pygments, etc.), download the latest packages from pypi.python.org and create a self contained installation in `/opt/user/trac`.\n\nAll commands (`tracd`, `trac-admin`) are available in `/opt/user/trac/bin`. This can also be leveraged for `mod_python` (using `PythonHandler` directive) and `mod_wsgi` (using `WSGIDaemonProcess` directive).\n\nAdditionally, you can install several Trac plugins (listed [https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=browse&show=all&c=516 here]) through pip.\n\n=== From source\n\nUsing the python-typical setup at the top of the source directory also works. You can obtain the source for a .tar.gz or .zip file corresponding to a release (e.g. `Trac-1.0.tar.gz`) from the [trac:TracDownload] page, or you can get the source directly from the repository. See [trac:TracRepositories#OfficialSubversionrepository TracRepositories] for details.\n\n{{{#!sh\n$ python ./setup.py install\n}}}\n\nYou will need root permissions or equivalent for this step.\n\nThis will byte-compile the Python source code and install it as an .egg file or folder in the `site-packages` directory\nof your Python installation. The .egg will also contain all other resources needed by standard Trac, such as `htdocs` and `templates`.\n\nIf you install from source and want to make Trac available in other languages, make sure Babel is installed. Only then, perform the `install` (or simply redo the `install` once again afterwards if you realize Babel was not yet installed):\n{{{#!sh\n$ python ./setup.py install\n}}}\n\nAlternatively, you can run `bdist_egg` and copy the .egg from `dist/` to the place of your choice, or you can create a Windows installer (`bdist_wininst`).\n\n=== Using installer\n\nOn Windows Trac can be installed using the exe installers available on the [trac:TracDownload] page. Installers are available for the 32 and 64 bit versions of Python. Make sure to use the installer that matches the architecture of your Python installation.\n\n=== Using package manager\n\nTrac may be available in the package repository for your platform. Note however, that the version provided by the package manager may not be the latest release.\n\n=== Advanced `easy_install` Options\n\nTo install Trac to a custom location, or find out about other advanced installation options, run:\n{{{#!sh\n$ easy_install --help\n}}}\n\nAlso see [http://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html Installing Python Modules] for detailed information.\n\nSpecifically, you might be interested in:\n{{{#!sh\n$ easy_install --prefix=/path/to/installdir\n}}}\n\nor, if installing Trac on a Mac OS X system:\n{{{#!sh\n$ easy_install --prefix=/usr/local --install-dir=/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': If installing on Mac OS X 10.6 running {{{ easy_install http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/trac/trunk }}} will install into {{{ /usr/local }}} and {{{ /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages }}} by default.\n\nThe above will place your `tracd` and `trac-admin` commands into `/usr/local/bin` and will install the Trac libraries and dependencies into `/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages`, which is Apple\'s preferred location for third-party Python application installations.\n\n== Creating a Project Environment\n\nA [TracEnvironment Trac environment] is the backend where Trac stores information like wiki pages, tickets, reports, settings, etc. An environment is basically a directory that contains a human-readable [TracIni configuration file], and other files and directories.\n\nA new environment is created using [TracAdmin trac-admin]:\n{{{#!sh\n$ trac-admin /path/to/myproject initenv\n}}}\n\n[TracAdmin trac-admin] will prompt you for the information it needs to create the environment, such as the name of the project and the [TracEnvironment#DatabaseConnectionStrings database connection string]. If you\'re not sure what to specify for one of these options, just press `<Enter>` to use the default value. \n\nUsing the default database connection string in particular will always work as long as you have SQLite installed.\nFor the other [trac:DatabaseBackend database backends] you should plan ahead and already have a database ready to use at this point.\n\nSince 0.12, Trac doesn\'t ask for a [TracEnvironment#SourceCodeRepository source code repository] anymore when creating an environment. Repositories can be [TracRepositoryAdmin added] afterwards, and support for specific version control systems is disabled by default.\n\nAlso note that the values you specify here can be changed later by directly editing the [TracIni conf/trac.ini] configuration file.\n\n{{{#!div style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n**Filesystem Warning:** When selecting the location of your environment, make sure that the filesystem on which the environment directory resides supports sub-second timestamps (i.e. **not** `ext2` or `ext3` on Linux, or HFS+ on OSX), as the modification time of the `conf/trac.ini` file will be monitored to decide whether an environment restart is needed or not. A too coarse-grained timestamp resolution may result in inconsistencies in Trac < 1.0.2. The best advice is to opt for a platform with sub-second timestamp resolution, regardless of the Trac version.\n}}}\n\nFinally, make sure the user account under which the web front-end runs will have \'\'\'write permissions\'\'\' to the environment directory and all the files inside. This will be the case if you run `trac-admin ... initenv` as this user. If not, you should set the correct user afterwards. For example on Linux, with the web server running as user `apache` and group `apache`, enter:\n{{{#!sh\n$ chown -R apache.apache /path/to/myproject\n}}}\n\nThe actual username and groupname of the Apache server may not be exactly `apache`, and are specified in the Apache configuration file by the directives `User` and `Group` (if Apache `httpd` is what you use).\n\n{{{#!div class=important\n\'\'\'Warning:\'\'\' Please only use ASCII-characters for account name and project path, unicode characters are not supported there.\n}}}\n\n== Deploying Trac\n\n{{{#!div style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n**Setuptools Warning:** If the version of your setuptools is in the range 5.4 through 5.6, the environment variable `PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS` must be set in order to avoid significant performance degradation.\n\nIf running `tracd`, the environment variable can be set system-wide or for just the user that runs the `tracd` process. There are several ways to accomplish this in addition to what is discussed here, and depending on the distribution of your OS.\n\nTo be effective system-wide a shell script with the `export` statement may be added to `/etc/profile.d`. To be effective for a user session the `export` statement may be added to `~/.profile`.\n{{{#!sh\nexport PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS=1\n}}}\n\nAlternatively, the variable can be set in the shell before executing `tracd`:\n{{{#!sh\n$ PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS=1 tracd --port 8000 /path/to/myproject\n}}}\n\nIf running the Apache web server, !Ubuntu/Debian users should add the `export` statement to `/etc/apache2/envvars`. !RedHat/CentOS/Fedora should can add the `export` statement to `/etc/sysconfig/httpd`.\n}}}\n\n=== Running the Standalone Server\n\nAfter having created a Trac environment, you can easily try the web interface by running the standalone server [TracStandalone tracd]:\n{{{#!sh\n$ tracd --port 8000 /path/to/myproject\n}}}\n\nThen, fire up a browser and visit `http://localhost:8000/`. You should get a simple listing of all environments that `tracd` knows about. Follow the link to the environment you just created, and you should see Trac in action. If you only plan on managing a single project with Trac you can have the standalone server skip the environment list by starting it like this:\n{{{#!sh\n$ tracd -s --port 8000 /path/to/myproject\n}}}\n\n=== Running Trac on a Web Server\n\nTrac provides various options for connecting to a \"real\" web server: \n - [TracFastCgi FastCGI]\n - [wiki:TracModWSGI Apache with mod_wsgi] \n - [TracModPython Apache with mod_python]\n - //[TracCgi CGI]: should not be used, as it degrades performance//\n\nTrac also supports [trac:TracOnWindowsIisAjp AJP] which may be your choice if you want to connect to IIS. Other deployment scenarios are possible: [trac:TracNginxRecipe nginx], [http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/wiki/Example#Traconapacheinasub-uri uwsgi], [trac:TracOnWindowsIisIsapi Isapi-wsgi] etc.\n\n==== Generating the Trac cgi-bin directory #cgi-bin\n\nIn order for Trac to function properly with FastCGI you need to have a `trac.fcgi` file and for mod_wsgi a `trac.wsgi` file. These are Python scripts which load the appropriate Python code. They can be generated using the `deploy` option of [TracAdmin trac-admin].\n\nThere is, however, a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem. The [TracAdmin trac-admin] command requires an existing environment to function, but complains if the deploy directory already exists. This is a problem, because environments are often stored in a subdirectory of the deploy. The solution is to do something like this:\n{{{#!sh\n$ mkdir -p /usr/share/trac/projects/my-project\n$ trac-admin /usr/share/trac/projects/my-project initenv\n$ trac-admin /usr/share/trac/projects/my-project deploy /tmp/deploy\n$ mv /tmp/deploy/* /usr/share/trac\n}}}\n\nDon\'t forget to check that the web server has the execution right on scripts in the `/usr/share/trac/cgi-bin` directory.\n\n==== Mapping Static Resources\n\nWithout additional configuration, Trac will handle requests for static resources such as stylesheets and images. For anything other than a TracStandalone deployment, this is not optimal as the web server can be set up to directly serve the static resources. For CGI setup, this is \'\'\'highly undesirable\'\'\' as it causes abysmal performance.\n\nWeb servers such as [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] allow you to create //Aliases// to resources, giving them a virtual URL that doesn\'t necessarily reflect their location on the file system. We can map requests for static resources directly to directories on the file system, to avoid Trac processing the requests.\n\nThere are two primary URL paths for static resources: `/chrome/common` and `/chrome/site`. Plugins can add their own resources, usually accessible at the `/chrome/<plugin>` path.\n\nA single `/chrome` alias can used if the static resources are extracted for all plugins. This means that the `deploy` command must be executed after installing or updating a plugin that provides static resources, or after modifying resources in the `$env/htdocs` directory. This is probably appropriate for most installations but may not be what you want if, for example, you wish to upload plugins through the //Plugins// administration page.\n\nThe resources are extracted using the [TracAdmin trac-admin]` <environment> deploy` command:\n[[TracAdminHelp(deploy)]]\n\nThe target `<directory>` will contain an `htdocs` directory with:\n - `common/` - the static resources of Trac\n - `site/` - a copy of the environment\'s `htdocs/` directory\n - `shared` - the static resources shared by multiple Trac environments, with a location defined by the `[inherit]` `htdocs_dir` option\n - `<plugin>/` - one directory for each resource directory provided by the plugins enabled for this environment\n\nThe example that follows will create a single `/chrome` alias. If that isn\'t the correct approach for your installation you simply need to create more specific aliases:\n{{{#!apache\nAlias /trac/chrome/common /path/to/trac/htdocs/common\nAlias /trac/chrome/site /path/to/trac/htdocs/site\nAlias /trac/chrome/shared /path/to/trac/htdocs/shared\nAlias /trac/chrome/<plugin> /path/to/trac/htdocs/<plugin>\n}}}\n\n===== Example: Apache and `ScriptAlias` #ScriptAlias-example\n\nAssuming the deployment has been done this way:\n{{{#!sh\n$ trac-admin /var/trac/env deploy /path/to/shared/trac\n}}}\n\nAdd the following snippet to Apache configuration, changing paths to match your deployment. The snippet must be placed \'\'before\'\' the `ScriptAlias` or `WSGIScriptAlias` directive, because those directives map all requests to the Trac application:\n{{{#!apache\nAlias /trac/chrome /path/to/trac/htdocs\n\n<Directory \"/path/to/www/trac/htdocs\">\n  # For Apache 2.2\n  <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n  </IfModule>\n  # For Apache 2.4\n  <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>\n    Require all granted\n  </IfModule>\n</Directory>\n}}}\n\nIf using mod_python, add this too, otherwise the alias will be ignored:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location \"/trac/chrome/common\">\n  SetHandler None\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to serve static resources directly from your project\'s `htdocs` directory rather than the location to which the files are extracted with the `deploy` command, you can configure Apache to serve those resources. Again, put this \'\'before\'\' the `ScriptAlias` or `WSGIScriptAlias` for the .*cgi scripts, and adjust names and locations to match your installation:\n{{{#!apache\nAlias /trac/chrome/site /path/to/projectenv/htdocs\n\n<Directory \"/path/to/projectenv/htdocs\">\n  # For Apache 2.2\n  <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n  </IfModule>\n  # For Apache 2.4\n  <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>\n    Require all granted\n  </IfModule>\n</Directory>\n}}}\n\nAnother alternative to aliasing `/trac/chrome/common` is having Trac generate direct links for those static resources (and only those), using the [[TracIni#trac-section| [trac] htdocs_location]] configuration setting:\n{{{#!ini\n[trac]\nhtdocs_location = http://static.example.org/trac-common/\n}}}\n\nNote that this makes it easy to have a dedicated domain serve those static resources, preferentially cookie-less.\n\nOf course, you still need to make the Trac `htdocs/common` directory available through the web server at the specified URL, for example by copying (or linking) the directory into the document root of the web server:\n{{{#!sh\n$ ln -s /path/to/trac/htdocs/common /var/www/static.example.org/trac-common\n}}}\n\n==== Setting up the Plugin Cache\n\nSome Python plugins need to be extracted to a cache directory. By default the cache resides in the home directory of the current user. When running Trac on a Web Server as a dedicated user (which is highly recommended) who has no home directory, this might prevent the plugins from starting. To override the cache location you can set the `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` environment variable. Refer to your server documentation for detailed instructions on how to set environment variables.\n\n== Configuring Authentication\n\nTrac uses HTTP authentication. You\'ll need to configure your webserver to request authentication when the `.../login` URL is hit (the virtual path of the \"login\" button). Trac will automatically pick the `REMOTE_USER` variable up after you provide your credentials. Therefore, all user management goes through your web server configuration. Please consult the documentation of your web server for more info.\n\nThe process of adding, removing, and configuring user accounts for authentication depends on the specific way you run Trac. \n\nPlease refer to one of the following sections:\n * TracStandalone#UsingAuthentication if you use the standalone server, `tracd`.\n * [wiki:TracModWSGI#ConfiguringAuthentication TracModWSGI#ConfiguringAuthentication] if you use the Apache web server, with any of its front end: `mod_wsgi` of course, but the same instructions applies also for `mod_python`, `mod_fcgi` or `mod_fastcgi`.\n * TracFastCgi if you are using another web server with FCGI support, such as Cherokee, Lighttpd, !LiteSpeed, nginx.\n\nThe following document also contains some useful information for beginners: [trac:TracAuthenticationIntroduction].\n\n== Granting admin rights to the admin user\n\nGrant admin rights to user admin:\n{{{#!sh\n$ trac-admin /path/to/myproject permission add admin TRAC_ADMIN\n}}}\n\nThis user will have an \"Admin\" entry menu that will allow you to administrate your Trac project.\n\n== Finishing the install\n\n=== Enable version control components\n\nSupport for version control systems is provided by optional components in Trac and the components are disabled by default //(since 1.0)//. Subversion and Git must be explicitly enabled if you wish to use them. See TracRepositoryAdmin for more details.\n\nThe version control systems are enabled by adding the following to the `[components]` section of your [TracIni#components-section trac.ini], or enabling the components in the \"Plugins\" admin panel:\n\n{{{#!ini\n[components]\ntracopt.versioncontrol.svn.* = enabled\n}}}\n\n{{{#!ini\n[components]\ntracopt.versioncontrol.git.* = enabled\n}}}\n\nAfter enabling the components, repositories can be configured through the //Repositories// admin panel or by editing [TracIni#repositories-section trac.ini]. Automatic changeset references can be inserted as ticket comments by configuring [TracRepositoryAdmin#Automaticchangesetreferencesintickets CommitTicketUpdater].\n\n=== Using Trac\n\nOnce you have your Trac site up and running, you should be able to create tickets, view the timeline, browse your version control repository if configured, etc.\n\nKeep in mind that //anonymous// (not logged in) users can by default access only a few of the features, in particular they will have a read-only access to the resources. You will need to configure authentication and grant additional [TracPermissions permissions] to authenticated users to see the full set of features.\n\n\'\' Enjoy! \'\'\n\n[trac:TracTeam The Trac Team]\n\n----\nSee also: [trac:TracInstallPlatforms TracInstallPlatforms], TracGuide, TracUpgrade, TracPermissions',NULL,NULL),('TracInterfaceCustomization',1,1629200947690725,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Customizing the Trac Interface\n\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n[[PageOutline(2-5,Contents,pullout)]]\n\nThis page gives suggestions on how to customize the look of Trac. Topics include editing the HTML templates and CSS files, but not the program code itself. The topics show users how they can modify the look of Trac to meet their specific needs. Suggestions for changes to Trac\'s interface applicable to all users should be filed as tickets, not listed on this page.\n\n== Project Logo and Icon\n\nThe easiest parts of the Trac interface to customize are the logo and the site icon. Both of these can be configured with settings in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini].\n\nThe logo or icon image should be put in a folder named \"htdocs\" in your project\'s environment folder. \'\'Note: in projects created with a Trac version prior to 0.9 you will need to create this folder\'\'.\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': you can actually put the logo and icon anywhere on your server (as long as it\'s accessible through the web server), and use their absolute or server-relative URLs in the configuration.\n\nNow configure the appropriate section of your [wiki:TracIni trac.ini]:\n\n=== Logo\n\nChange the `src` setting to `site/` followed by the name of your image file. The `width` and `height` settings should be modified to match your image\'s dimensions. The Trac chrome handler uses `site/` for files within the project directory `htdocs`, and `common/` for the common `htdocs` directory belonging to a Trac installation. Note that \'site/\' is not a placeholder for your project name, it is the literal prefix that should be used. For example, if your project is named \'sandbox\', and the image file is \'red_logo.gif\' then the \'src\' setting would be \'site/red_logo.gif\', not \'sandbox/red_logo.gif\'.\n\n{{{#!ini\n[header_logo]\nsrc = site/my_logo.gif\nalt = My Project\nwidth = 300\nheight = 100\n}}}\n\n=== Icon\n\nIcons are small images displayed by your web browser next to the site\'s URL and in the `Bookmarks` menu. Icons should be a 32x32 image in `.gif` or `.ico` format. Change the `icon` setting to `site/` followed by the name of your icon file:\n\n{{{#!ini\n[project]\nicon = site/my_icon.ico\n}}}\n\n== Custom Navigation Entries\n\nThe new [mainnav] and [metanav] can now be used to customize the text and link used for the navigation items, or even to disable them, but not for adding new ones.\n\nIn the following example, we rename the link to the Wiki start \"Home\", and hide the \"!Help/Guide\". We also make the \"View Tickets\" entry link to a specific report:\n{{{#!ini\n[mainnav]\nwiki.label = Home\ntickets.href = /report/24\n\n[metanav]\nhelp = disabled\n}}}\n\nSee also TracNavigation for a more detailed explanation of the mainnav and metanav terms.\n\n== Site Appearance #SiteAppearance\n\nTrac is using [http://genshi.edgewall.org Genshi] as the templating engine. Say you want to add a link to a custom stylesheet, and then your own header and footer. Save the following content as `site.html` inside your projects `templates/` directory (each Trac project can have their own `site.html`), eg `/path/to/env/templates/site.html`:\n\n{{{#!xml\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n      xmlns:py=\"http://genshi.edgewall.org/\"\n      py:strip=\"\">\n\n  <!--! Add site-specific style sheet -->\n  <head py:match=\"head\" py:attrs=\"select(\'@*\')\">\n    ${select(\'*|comment()|text()\')}\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"${href.chrome(\'site/style.css\')}\" />\n  </head>\n\n  <body py:match=\"body\" py:attrs=\"select(\'@*\')\">\n    <!--! Add site-specific header -->\n    <div id=\"siteheader\">\n      <!--! Place your header content here... -->\n    </div>\n\n    ${select(\'*|text()\')}\n\n    <!--! Add site-specific footer -->\n    <div id=\"sitefooter\">\n      <!--! Place your footer content here... -->\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n}}}\n\nNotice that XSLT bears some similarities with Genshi templates. However, there are some Trac specific features, for example the `${href.chrome(\'site/style.css\')}` attribute references `style.css` in the environment\'s `htdocs/` directory. In a similar fashion `${chrome.htdocs_location}` is used to specify the common `htdocs/` directory belonging to a Trac installation. That latter location can however be overriden using the [[TracIni#trac-section|[trac] htdocs_location]] configuration setting.\n\n`site.html` is one file to contain all your modifications. It usually works using the `py:match` directive (element or attribute), and it allows you to modify the page as it renders. The matches hook onto specific sections depending on what it tries to find and modify them.\nSee [http://groups.google.com/group/trac-users/browse_thread/thread/70487fb2c406c937/ this thread] for a detailed explanation of the above example `site.html`.\nA `site.html` can contain any number of such `py:match` sections for whatever you need to modify. This is all Genshi, so the [http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/xml-templates.html docs on the exact syntax] can be found there.\n\nExample snippet of adding introduction text to the new ticket form (but not shown during preview):\n\n{{{#!xml\n<form py:match=\"div[@id=\'content\' and @class=\'ticket\']/form\" py:attrs=\"select(\'@*\')\">\n  <py:if test=\"req.path_info == \'/newticket\' and (not \'preview\' in req.args)\">\n    <p>Please make sure to search for existing tickets before reporting a new one!</p>\n  </py:if>\n  ${select(\'*\')} \n</form>\n}}}\n\nThis example illustrates a technique of using `req.path_info` to limit scope of changes to one view only. For instance, to make changes in `site.html` only for timeline and avoid modifying other sections - use `req.path_info == \'/timeline\'` condition in `<py:if>` test.\n\nMore examples snippets for `site.html` can be found at [trac:wiki:CookBook/SiteHtml CookBook/SiteHtml].\n\nExample snippets for `style.css` can be found at [trac:wiki:CookBook/SiteStyleCss CookBook/SiteStyleCss].\n\nIf the environment is upgraded from 0.10 and a `site_newticket.cs` file already exists, it can be loaded using a workaround, provided it contains no [trac:ClearSilver] processing. In addition, as only one element can be imported, the content needs a wrapper, such as a `<div>` block or other similar parent container. The XInclude namespace must be specified to allow includes, but that can be moved to document root along with the others:\n{{{#!xml\n<form py:match=\"div[@id=\'content\' and @class=\'ticket\']/form\" py:attrs=\"select(\'@*\')\"\n        xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\">\n  <py:if test=\"req.path_info == \'/newticket\' and (not \'preview\' in req.args)\"> \n    <xi:include href=\"site_newticket.cs\"><xi:fallback /></xi:include>\n  </py:if>\n  ${select(\'*\')} \n</form>\n}}}\n\nAlso note that the `site.html`, despite its name, can be put in a shared templates directory, see the [[TracIni#inherit-section|[inherit] templates_dir]] option. This could provide easier maintenance (and a migration path from 0.10 for larger installations) as one new global `site.html` file can be made to include any existing header, footer and newticket snippets.\n\n== Project List #ProjectList\n\nYou can use a custom Genshi template to display the list of projects if you are using Trac with multiple projects.\n\nThe following is the basic template used by Trac to display a list of links to the projects. For projects that could not be loaded, it displays an error message. You can use this as a starting point for your own index template:\n\n{{{#!text/html\n<!DOCTYPE html\n    PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n      xmlns:py=\"http://genshi.edgewall.org/\"\n      xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\">\n  <head>\n    <title>Available Projects</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Available Projects</h1>\n    <ul>\n      <li py:for=\"project in projects\" py:choose=\"\">\n        <a py:when=\"project.href\" href=\"$project.href\"\n           title=\"$project.description\">$project.name</a>\n        <py:otherwise>\n          <small>$project.name: <em>Error</em> <br /> ($project.description)</small>\n        </py:otherwise>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n}}}\n\nOnce you\'ve created your custom template you will need to configure the webserver to tell Trac where the template is located:\n\nFor [wiki:TracModWSGI mod_wsgi]:\n{{{#!python\nos.environ[\'TRAC_ENV_INDEX_TEMPLATE\'] = \'/path/to/template.html\'\n}}}\n\nFor [wiki:TracFastCgi FastCGI]:\n{{{#!apache\nFastCgiConfig -initial-env TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR=/parent/dir/of/projects \\\n              -initial-env TRAC_ENV_INDEX_TEMPLATE=/path/to/template\n}}}\n\nFor [wiki:TracModPython mod_python]:\n{{{#!apache\nPythonOption TracEnvParentDir /parent/dir/of/projects\nPythonOption TracEnvIndexTemplate /path/to/template\n}}}\n\nFor [wiki:TracCgi CGI]:\n{{{#!apache\nSetEnv TRAC_ENV_INDEX_TEMPLATE /path/to/template\n}}}\n\nFor [wiki:TracStandalone], you\'ll need to set up the `TRAC_ENV_INDEX_TEMPLATE` environment variable in the shell used to launch tracd:\n - Unix:\n   {{{#!sh\n$ export TRAC_ENV_INDEX_TEMPLATE=/path/to/template\n   }}}\n - Windows:\n   {{{#!sh\n$ set TRAC_ENV_INDEX_TEMPLATE=/path/to/template\n   }}}\n\n== Project Templates\n\nThe appearance of each individual Trac environment, ie instance of a project, can be customized independently of other projects, even those hosted on the same server. The recommended way is to use a `site.html` template whenever possible, see [#SiteAppearance]. Using `site.html` means changes are made to the original templates as they are rendered, and you should not normally need to redo modifications whenever Trac is upgraded. If you do make a copy of `theme.html` or any other Trac template, you need to migrate your modifiations to the newer version. If not, new Trac features or bug fixes may not work as expected.\n\nWith that word of caution, any Trac template may be copied and customized. The default Trac templates are located inside the installed Trac egg, such as `/usr/lib/pythonVERSION/site-packages/Trac-VERSION.egg/trac/templates, ../trac/ticket/templates, ../trac/wiki/templates`. The [#ProjectList] template file is called `index.html`, while the template responsible for main layout is called `theme.html`. Page assets such as images and CSS style sheets are located in the egg\'s `trac/htdocs` directory.\n\nHowever, do not edit templates or site resources inside the Trac egg. Reinstalling Trac overwrites your modifications. Instead use one of these alternatives:\n * For a modification to one project only, copy the template to project `templates` directory.\n * For a modification shared by several projects, copy the template to a shared location and have each project point to this location using the `[inherit] templates_dir` trac.ini option.\n\nTrac resolves requests for a template by first looking inside the project, then in any inherited templates location, and finally inside the Trac egg.\n\nTrac caches templates in memory by default to improve performance. To apply a template you need to restart the web server.\n\n----\nSee also TracGuide, TracIni',NULL,NULL),('TracLinks',1,1629200947773083,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac Links\n\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n[[PageOutline(2-5,Contents,pullout)]]\n\nTracLinks are a fundamental feature of Trac, because they allow easy hyperlinking between the various entities in the system — such as tickets, reports, changesets, Wiki pages, milestones, and source files — from anywhere where WikiFormatting is used.\n\nTracLinks are generally of the form \'\'\'type:id\'\'\' (where \'\'id\'\' represents the number, name or path of the item) though some frequently used kinds of items also have short-hand notations.\n\n== Where to use TracLinks\n\nYou can use TracLinks in:\n\n * Source code (Subversion) commit messages\n * Wiki pages\n * Full descriptions for tickets, reports and milestones\n\nand any other text fields explicitly marked as supporting WikiFormatting.\n\n== Overview\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n Wiki pages :: `CamelCase` or `wiki:CamelCase`\n Parent page :: `[..]`\n Tickets :: `#1` or `ticket:1`\n Ticket comments :: `comment:1:ticket:2`\n Reports :: `{1}` or `report:1`\n Milestones :: `milestone:1.0`\n Attachment :: `attachment:example.tgz` (for current page attachment), `attachment:attachment.1073.diff:ticket:944` (absolute path)\n Changesets :: `r1`, `[1]`, `changeset:1` or (restricted) `[1/trunk]`, `changeset:1/trunk`, `[1/repository]`\n Revision log :: `r1:3`, `[1:3]` or `log:@1:3`, `log:trunk@1:3`, `[2:5/trunk]`\n Diffs :: `diff:@1:3`, `diff:plugins/0.12/mercurial-plugin@9128:9953`,\n          `diff:tags/trac-0.9.2/wiki-default//tags/trac-0.9.3/wiki-default` \n          or `diff:trunk/trac@3538//sandbox/vc-refactoring@3539`\n Files :: `source:trunk/COPYING`, `source:/trunk/COPYING@200` (at version 200), `source:/trunk/COPYING@200#L25` (at version 200, line 25)\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n Wiki pages :: CamelCase or wiki:CamelCase\n Parent page :: [..]\n Tickets :: #1 or ticket:1\n Ticket comments :: comment:1:ticket:2 \n Reports :: {1} or report:1\n Milestones :: milestone:1.0\n Attachment :: attachment:example.tgz (for current page attachment), attachment:attachment.1073.diff:ticket:944 (absolute path)\n Changesets :: r1, [1], changeset:1 or (restricted) [1/trunk], changeset:1/trunk, [1/repository]\n Revision log :: r1:3, [1:3] or log:@1:3, log:trunk@1:3, [2:5/trunk]\n Diffs :: diff:@1:3, diff:plugins/0.12/mercurial-plugin@9128:9953,\n          diff:tags/trac-0.9.2/wiki-default//tags/trac-0.9.3/wiki-default \n          or diff:trunk/trac@3538//sandbox/vc-refactoring@3539\n Files :: source:trunk/COPYING, source:/trunk/COPYING@200 (at version 200), source:/trunk/COPYING@200#L25 (at version 200, line 25)\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' The wiki:CamelCase form is rarely used, but it can be convenient to refer to pages whose names do not follow WikiPageNames rules, ie single words, non-alphabetic characters, etc. See WikiPageNames for more about features specific to links to Wiki page names.\n\n\n{{{#!table class=\"\"\n|||| Trac links using the full (non-shorthand) notation can also be given a custom link title like this: ||\n{{{#!td\n{{{\n[ticket:1 This is a link to ticket number one] or\n[[ticket:1|This is another link to ticket number one]].\n}}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n[ticket:1 This is a link to ticket number one] or\n[[ticket:1|This is another link to ticket number one]].\n}}}\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|||| If the title is omitted, only the id (the part after the colon) is displayed:  ||\n{{{#!td\n{{{\n[ticket:1] or [[ticket:2]]\n}}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n[ticket:1] or [[ticket:2]]\n}}}\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|||| `wiki` is the default if the namespace part of a full link is omitted:  || \n{{{#!td\n{{{\n[SandBox the sandbox] or\n[[SandBox|the sandbox]]\n}}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n[SandBox the sandbox] or\n[[SandBox|the sandbox]]\n}}}\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|||| The short form \'\'realm:target\'\' can also be wrapped within a <...> pair, [[br]] which allow for arbitrary characters (i.e. anything but >)  ||\n{{{#!td\n{{{\n<wiki:Strange(page@!)>\n}}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n<wiki:Strange(page@!)>\n}}}\n}}}\n\nTracLinks are a very simple idea, but actually allow quite a complex network of information. In practice, it\'s very intuitive and simple to use, and we\'ve found the \"link trail\" extremely helpful to better understand what\'s happening in a project or why a particular change was made.\n\n== Advanced use of TracLinks\n\n=== Relative links\n\nTo create a link to a [trac:SubWiki SubWiki]-page just use a \'/\':\n{{{\n WikiPage/SubWikiPage or ./SubWikiPage\n}}}\n\nTo link from a [trac:SubWiki SubWiki] page to a parent, simply use a \'..\':\n{{{\n  [..] or [[..]]\n}}}\n  [..] or [[..]]\n\nTo link from a [trac:SubWiki SubWiki] page to a [=#sibling sibling] page, use a \'../\':\n{{{\n  [../Sibling see next sibling] or [[../Sibling|see next sibling]]\n}}}\n  [../Sibling see next sibling] or [[../Sibling|see next sibling]]\n\nBut in practice you often won\'t need to add the `../` prefix to link to a sibling page.\nFor resolving the location of a wiki link, it\'s the target page closest in the hierarchy to the page where the link is written which will be selected. So for example, within a sub-hierarchy, a sibling page will be targeted in preference to a toplevel page.\nThis makes it easy to copy or move pages to a sub-hierarchy by [[WikiNewPage#renaming|renaming]] without having to adapt the links.\n\nTo link explicitly to a [=#toplevel toplevel] Wiki page, use the `wiki:/` prefix. Be careful **not** to use the `/` prefix alone, as this corresponds to the [#Server-relativelinks] syntax and with such a link you will lack the `/wiki/` part in the resulting URL. A link such as `[../newticket]` will stay in the wiki namespace and therefore link to a sibling page.\n\n=== Link anchors\n\nTo create a link to a specific anchor in a page, use \'#\':\n{{{\n [#Linkanchors Link anchors] or [[#Linkanchors|Link anchors]]\n}}}\n  [#Linkanchors Link anchors] or [[#Linkanchors|Link anchors]]\n\nHint: when you move your mouse over the title of a section, a \'¶\' character will be displayed. This is a link to that specific section and you can use this to copy the `#...` part inside a relative link to an anchor.\n\nTo create a link to the first or last occurrence of a term on a page, use a \'\'pseudo anchor\'\' starting with \'#/\' or \'#?\':\n{{{\n [#/Milestone first occurrence of Milestone] or\n [#?Milestone last occurrence of Milestone]\n}}}\n [#/Milestone first occurrence of Milestone] or\n [#?Milestone last occurrence of Milestone]\nThis will also highlight all other matches on the linked page. By default only case sensitive matches are considered. To include case insensitive matches append \'/i\':\n{{{\n [#/Milestone/i first occurrence of Milestone or milestone] or\n [#?Milestone/i last occurrence of Milestone or milestone]\n}}}\n [#/Milestone/i first occurrence of Milestone or milestone] or\n [#?Milestone/i last occurrence of Milestone or milestone]\n\n\'\'(since Trac 1.0)\'\'\n\nSuch anchors can be very useful for linking to specific lines in a file in the source browser:\n{{{\n [trac:source:tags/trac-0.12/trac/wiki/api.py#L127 Line 127] or\n [trac:source:tags/trac-0.12/trac/ticket/roadmap.py#L47 Line 47]\n}}}\n [trac:source:tags/trac-0.12/trac/wiki/api.py#L127 Line 127] or\n [trac:source:tags/trac-0.12/trac/ticket/roadmap.py#L47 Line 47]\n(Hint: The line numbers displayed in the source browser are links to anchors on the respective lines.)\n\nSince such links become outdated when the file changes, it can be useful to link using a \'#/\' pseudo anchor instead:\n{{{\n [trac:source:trunk/trac/wiki/api.py#/IWikiSyntaxProvider IWikiSyntaxProvider] or\n [trac:source:trunk/trac/env.py#/ISystemInfoProvider ISystemInfoProvider]\n}}}\n [trac:source:trunk/trac/wiki/api.py#/IWikiSyntaxProvider IWikiSyntaxProvider] or\n [trac:source:trunk/trac/env.py#/ISystemInfoProvider ISystemInfoProvider]\n\n=== InterWiki links\n\nOther prefixes can be defined freely and made to point to resources in other Web applications. The definition of those prefixes as well as the URLs of the corresponding Web applications is defined in a special Wiki page, the InterMapTxt page. Note that while this could be used to create links to other Trac environments, there is a more specialized way to register other Trac environments which offers greater flexibility.\n\n=== InterTrac links\n\nThis can be seen as a kind of InterWiki link specialized for targeting other Trac projects.\n\nAny type of Trac link can be written in one Trac environment and actually refer to resources in another Trac environment. All that is required is to prefix the Trac link with the name of the other Trac environment followed by a colon. The other Trac environment must be registered on the InterTrac page. \n\nA distinctive advantage of InterTrac links over InterWiki links is that the shorthand form of Trac links (e.g. `{}`, `r`, `#`) can also be used. For example if T was set as an alias for Trac, links to Trac tickets can be written #T234, links to Trac changesets can be written [trac 1508].\nSee InterTrac for the complete details. \n\n=== Server-relative links\n\nIt is often useful to be able to link to objects in your project that have no built-in Trac linking mechanism, such as static resources, `newticket`, a shared `/register` page on the server, etc.\n\nTo link to resources inside the project, use either an absolute path from the project root, or a relative link from the URL of the current page (\'\'Changed in 0.11\'\'):\n\n{{{\n[/newticket Create a new ticket] or [[//newticket|Create a new ticket]]\n[/ home] or [[/|home]]\n}}}\n\nDisplay: [/newticket Create a new ticket] or [[//newticket|Create a new ticket]]\n[/ home] or [[/|home]]\n\nTo link to another location on the server (possibly outside the project but on the same host), use the `//` prefix (\'\'Changed in 0.11\'\'):\n\n{{{\n[//register Register Here] or [[//register|Register Here]]\n}}}\n\nDisplay: [//register Register Here] or [[//register|Register Here]]\n\n=== Quoting space in TracLinks\n\nImmediately after a TracLinks prefix, targets containing space characters should be enclosed in a pair of quotes or double quotes.\nExamples:\n * !wiki:\"The whitespace convention\"\n * !attachment:\'the file.txt\' or\n * !attachment:\"the file.txt\" \n * !attachment:\"the file.txt:ticket:123\" \n\nNote that by using [trac:WikiCreole] style links, it\'s quite natural to write links containing spaces:\n * ![[The whitespace convention]]\n * ![[attachment:the file.txt]]\n\n=== Escaping Links\n\nTo prevent parsing of a !TracLink, you can escape it by preceding it with a \'!\' (exclamation mark).\n{{{\n !NoLinkHere.\n ![42] is not a link either.\n}}}\n\nDisplay:\n !NoLinkHere.\n ![42] is not a link either.\n\n=== Parameterized Trac links\n\nMany Trac resources have more than one way to be rendered, depending on some extra parameters. For example, a Wiki page can accept a `version` or a `format` parameter, a report can make use of dynamic variables, etc.\n\nTrac links can support an arbitrary set of parameters, written in the same way as they would be for the corresponding URL. Some examples:\n - `wiki:WikiStart?format=txt`\n - `ticket:1?version=1`\n - `[/newticket?component=module1 create a ticket for module1]`\n - `[/newticket?summary=Add+short+description+here create a ticket with URL with spaces]`\n\n== TracLinks Reference\n\nThe following sections describe the individual link types in detail, as well as notes on advanced usage of links.\n\n=== attachment: links\n\nThe link syntax for attachments is as follows:\n * !attachment:the_file.txt creates a link to the attachment the_file.txt of the current object\n * !attachment:the_file.txt:wiki:MyPage creates a link to the attachment the_file.txt of the !MyPage wiki page\n * !attachment:the_file.txt:ticket:753 creates a link to the attachment the_file.txt of the ticket 753\n\nNote that the older way, putting the filename at the end, is still supported: !attachment:ticket:753:the_file.txt.\n\nIf you\'d like to create a direct link to the content of the attached file instead of a link to the attachment page, simply use `raw-attachment:` instead of `attachment:`.\n\nThis can be useful for pointing directly to an HTML document, for example. Note that for this use case, you\'d have to allow the web browser to render the content by setting `[attachment] render_unsafe_content = yes` (see TracIni#attachment-section). Caveat: only do that in environments for which you\'re 100% confident you can trust the people who are able to attach files, as otherwise this would open up your site to [wikipedia:Cross-site_scripting cross-site scripting] attacks.\n\nSee also [#export:links].\n\n=== comment: links\n\nWhen you\'re inside a given ticket, you can simply write e.g. !comment:3 to link to the third change comment.\nIt is possible to link to a comment of a specific ticket from anywhere using one of the following syntax:\n - `comment:3:ticket:123` \n - `ticket:123#comment:3` (note that you can\'t write `#123#!comment:3`!)\nIt is also possible to link to the ticket\'s description using one of the following syntax:\n - `comment:description` (within the ticket)\n - `comment:description:ticket:123`\n - `ticket:123#comment:description`\n\n=== htdocs: links\n\nUse `htdocs:path/to/file` to reference files in the `htdocs` directory of the Trac environment, the [TracEnvironment#DirectoryStructure web resource directory].\n\n=== query: links\n\nSee TracQuery#UsingTracLinks and [#ticket:links].\n\n=== search: links\n\nSee TracSearch#SearchLinks \n\n=== ticket: links\n\n \'\'alias:\'\' `bug:`\n\nBesides the obvious `ticket:id` form, it is also possible to specify a list of tickets or even a range of tickets instead of the `id`. This generates a link to a custom query view containing this fixed set of tickets.\n\nExample: \n - `ticket:5000-6000`\n - `ticket:1,150`\n\n=== timeline: links\n\nLinks to the timeline can be created by specifying a date in the ISO:8601 format. The date can be optionally followed by a time specification. The time is interpreted as being UTC time, but if you don\'t want to compute the UTC time, you can specify a local time followed by your timezone offset relative to UTC.\n\nExamples:\n - `timeline:2008-01-29`\n - `timeline:2008-01-29T15:48`\n - `timeline:2008-01-29T15:48Z`\n - `timeline:2008-01-29T16:48+01`\n - `timeline:2008-01-29T16:48+0100`\n - `timeline:2008-01-29T16:48+01:00`\n\n=== wiki: links\n\nSee WikiPageNames and [#QuotingspaceinTracLinks quoting space in TracLinks] above. It is possible to create a link to a specific page revision using the syntax WikiStart@1.\n\n=== Version Control related links\n\nIt should be noted that multiple repository support works by creating a kind of virtual namespace for versioned files in which the toplevel folders correspond to the repository names. Therefore, in presence of multiple repositories, a \'\'/path\'\' specification in the syntax of links detailed below should start with the name of the repository. If omitted, the default repository is used. In case a toplevel folder of the default repository has the same name as a repository, the latter \"wins\". One can always access such folder by fully qualifying it. The default repository can be an alias of a named repository, or conversely, it is always possible to create an alias for the default repository, ask your Trac administrator.\n\nFor example, `source:/trunk/COPYING` targets the path `/trunk/COPYING` in the default repository, whereas `source:/projectA/trunk/COPYING` targets the path `/trunk/COPYING` in the repository named `projectA`. This can be the same file if `\'projectA\'` is an alias to the default repository or if `\'\'` (the default repository) is an alias to `\'projectA\'`.\n\n==== source: links\n\n \'\'aliases:\'\' `browser:`, `repos:`\n\nThe default behavior for a `source:/some/path link` is to open the browser in that directory directory if the path points to a directory or to show the latest content of the file.\n\nIt\'s also possible to link directly to a specific revision of a file like this:\n - `source:/some/file@123` - link to the file\'s revision 123\n - `source:/some/file@head` - link explicitly to the latest revision of the file\n - `source:/some/file@named-branch` - link to latest revision of the specified file in `named-branch` (DVCS such as Git or Mercurial)\n\nIf the revision is specified, one can even link to a specific line number:\n - `source:/some/file@123#L10`\n - `source:/tag/0.10@head#L10`\n - `source:/some/file@named-branch#L10`\n\nFinally, one can also highlight an arbitrary set of lines:\n - `source:/some/file@123:10-20,100,103#L99` - highlight lines 10 to 20, and lines 100 and 103, and target line 99\n - or without version number (the `@` is still needed): `source:/some/file@:10-20,100,103#L99`. Version can be omitted when the path is pointing to a source file that will no longer change (like `source:/tags/...`), otherwise it\'s better to specify which lines of //which version// of the file you\'re talking about.\n\nNote that in presence of multiple repositories, the name of the repository is simply integrated in the path you specify for `source:` (e.g. `source:reponame/trunk/README`). \'\'(since 0.12)\'\'\n\n==== export: links\n\nTo force the download of a file in the repository, as opposed to displaying it in the browser, use the `export` link.  Several forms are available:\n * `export:/some/file` - get the HEAD revision of the specified file\n * `export:123:/some/file` - get revision 123 of the specified file\n * `export:/some/file@123` - get revision 123 of the specified file\n * `export:/some/file@named-branch` - get latest revision of the specified file in `named-branch` (DVCS such as Git or Mercurial).\n\nThis can be very useful for displaying XML or HTML documentation with correct stylesheets and images, in case that has been checked in into the repository. Note that for this use case, you\'d have to allow the web browser to render the content by setting `[browser] render_unsafe_content = yes` (see TracIni#browser-section), otherwise Trac will force the files to be downloaded as attachments for security concerns. \n\nIf the path is to a directory in the repository instead of a specific file, the source browser will be used to display the directory (identical to the result of `source:/some/dir`).\n\n==== log: links\n\nThe `log:` links are used to display revision ranges. In its simplest form, it can link to the latest revisions of the specified path, but it can also support displaying an arbitrary set of revisions.\n - `log:/` - the latest revisions starting at the root of the repository\n - `log:/trunk/tools` - the latest revisions in `trunk/tools`\n - `log:/trunk/tools@10000` - the revisions in `trunk/tools` starting from  revision 10000\n - `log:@20788,20791:20795` - list revision 20788 and the revisions from 20791 to 20795 \n - `log:/trunk/tools@20788,20791:20795` - list revision 20788 and the revisions from 20791 to 20795 which affect the given path\n - `log:/tools@named-branch` - the revisions in `tools` starting from the latest revision in `named-branch` (DVCS such as Git or Mercurial)\n\nThere are short forms for revision ranges as well:\n - `[20788,20791:20795]`\n - `[20788,20791:20795/trunk/tools]`\n - `r20791:20795` (but not `r20788,20791:20795` nor `r20791:20795/trunk`)\n\nFinally, note that in all of the above, a revision range can be written either as `x:y` or `x-y`.\n\nIn the presence of multiple repositories, the name of the repository should be specified as the first part of the path, e.g. `log:repos/branches` or `[20-40/repos]`.\n\n----\nSee also: WikiFormatting, TracWiki, WikiPageNames, InterTrac, InterWiki\n ',NULL,NULL),('TracLogging',1,1629200947783081,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac Logging\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nTrac supports logging of system messages using the standard [http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html logging module] that comes with Python.\n\nLogging is configured in the `[logging]` section in [wiki:TracIni#logging-section trac.ini].\n\n== Supported Logging Methods\n\nThe log method is set using the `log_type` option in [wiki:TracIni#logging-section trac.ini], which takes any of the following values:\n\n \'\'\'none\'\':: Suppress all log messages.\n \'\'\'file\'\'\':: Log messages to a file, specified with the `log_file` option in [wiki:TracIni#logging-section trac.ini]. Relative paths in `log_file` are resolved relative to the `log` directory of the environment.\n \'\'\'stderr\'\'\':: Output all log entries to console ([wiki:TracStandalone tracd] only).\n \'\'\'syslog\'\'\':: (UNIX) Send all log messages to the local syslogd via named pipe `/dev/log`. By default, syslog will write them to the file /var/log/messages.\n \'\'\'eventlog\'\'\':: (Windows) Use the system\'s NT Event Log for Trac logging.\n\n== Log Levels\n\nThe verbosity level of logged messages can be set using the `log_level` option in [wiki:TracIni#logging-section trac.ini]. The log level defines the minimum level of urgency required for a message to be logged, and those levels are:\n\n \'\'\'CRITICAL\'\'\':: Log only the most critical (typically fatal) errors.\n \'\'\'ERROR\'\'\':: Log failures, bugs and errors. \n \'\'\'WARN\'\'\':: Log warnings, non-interrupting events.\n \'\'\'INFO\'\'\':: Diagnostic information, log information about all processing.\n \'\'\'DEBUG\'\'\':: Trace messages, profiling, etc.\n\nAdditionally, you can  enable logging of SQL statements at debug level. This is turned off by default, as it\'s very verbose. Set `[trac] debug_sql = yes` in TracIni to activate.\n\n== Log Format\n\nThe output format for log entries can be specified through the `log_format` option in [wiki:TracIni#logging-section trac.ini]. The format is a string which can contain any of the [http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes Python logging Formatter variables]. Additonally, the following Trac-specific variables can be used:\n \'\'\'$(basename)s\'\'\':: The last path component of the current environment.\n \'\'\'$(path)s\'\'\':: The absolute path for the current environment.\n \'\'\'$(project)s\'\'\':: The originating project\'s name.\n\nNote that variables are identified using a dollar sign (`$(...)s`) instead of percent sign (`%(...)s`).\n\nThe default format is:\n{{{#!ini\nlog_format = Trac[$(module)s] $(levelname)s: $(message)s\n}}}\n\nIn a multi-project environment where all logs are sent to the same place (e.g. `syslog`), it makes sense to add the project name. In this example we use `basename` since that can generally be used to identify a project:\n{{{#!ini\nlog_format = Trac[$(basename)s:$(module)s] $(levelname)s: $(message)s\n}}}\n\n----\nSee also: TracIni, TracGuide, TracEnvironment',NULL,NULL),('TracModPython',1,1629200947653991,'trac','127.0.0.1','[[TracGuideToc]]\n\n= Trac and mod_python\n\nMod_python is an [https://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] module that embeds the Python interpreter within the server, so that web-based applications in Python will run many times faster than traditional CGI and will have the ability to retain database connections.\nTrac supports [http://www.modpython.org/ mod_python], which speeds up Trac\'s response times considerably, especially compared to [TracCgi CGI], and permits use of many Apache features not possible with [wiki:TracStandalone tracd]/mod_proxy.\n\n[[PageOutline(2-3,Overview,inline)]]\n\n== Simple configuration: single project #Simpleconfiguration\n\nIf you just installed mod_python, you may have to add a line to load the module in the Apache configuration:\n{{{#!apache\nLoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': The exact path to the module depends on how the HTTPD installation is laid out.\n\nOn Debian using apt-get:\n{{{#!sh\napt-get install libapache2-mod-python libapache2-mod-python-doc\n}}}\n\nStill on Debian, after you have installed mod_python, you must enable the modules in apache2, equivalent to the above Load Module directive:\n{{{#!sh\na2enmod python\n}}}\n\nOn Fedora use, using yum:\n{{{#!sh\nyum install mod_python\n}}}\n\nYou can test your mod_python installation by adding the following to your httpd.conf. You should remove this when you are done testing for security reasons. Note: mod_python.testhandler is only available in mod_python 3.2+.\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /mpinfo>\n  SetHandler mod_python\n  PythonInterpreter main_interpreter\n  PythonHandler mod_python.testhandler\n  # For Apache 2.2\n  <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n  </IfModule>\n  # For Apache 2.4\n  <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>\n    Require all granted\n  </IfModule>\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nA simple setup of Trac on mod_python looks like this:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /projects/myproject>\n  SetHandler mod_python\n  PythonInterpreter main_interpreter\n  PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend \n  PythonOption TracEnv /var/trac/myproject\n  PythonOption TracUriRoot /projects/myproject\n  # For Apache 2.2\n  <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n  </IfModule>\n  # For Apache 2.4\n  <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>\n    Require all granted\n  </IfModule>\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nThe option \'\'\'`TracUriRoot`\'\'\' may or may not be necessary in your setup. Try your configuration without it; if the URLs produced by Trac look wrong, if Trac does not seem to recognize URLs correctly, or you get an odd \"No handler matched request to...\" error, add the \'\'\'`TracUriRoot`\'\'\' option. You will notice that the `Location` and \'\'\'`TracUriRoot`\'\'\' have the same path.\n\nThe options available are:\n{{{#!apache\n# For a single project\nPythonOption TracEnv /var/trac/myproject\n\n# For multiple projects\nPythonOption TracEnvParentDir /var/trac/myprojects\n\n# For the index of multiple projects\nPythonOption TracEnvIndexTemplate /srv/www/htdocs/trac/project_list_template.html\n\n# A space delimitted list, with a \",\" between key and value pairs.\nPythonOption TracTemplateVars key1,val1 key2,val2\n\n# Useful to get the date in the wanted order\nPythonOption TracLocale en_GB.UTF8\n\n# See description above        \nPythonOption TracUriRoot /projects/myproject\n}}}\n\n=== Python Egg Cache\n\nCompressed Python eggs like Genshi are normally extracted into a directory named `.python-eggs` in the users home directory. Since Apache\'s home usually is not writeable, an alternate egg cache directory can be specified like this:\n{{{#!apache\nPythonOption PYTHON_EGG_CACHE /var/trac/myprojects/egg-cache\n}}}\n\nOr you can uncompress the Genshi egg to resolve problems extracting from it.\n\n=== Configuring Authentication\n\nSee corresponding section in the [wiki:TracModWSGI#ConfiguringAuthentication] page.\n\n== Advanced Configuration\n\n=== Setting the Python Egg Cache\n\nIf the Egg Cache isn\'t writeable by your Web server, you\'ll either have to change the permissions, or point Python to a location where Apache can write. This can manifest itself as a `500 internal server error` and/or a complaint in the syslog. \n\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /projects/myproject>\n  ...\n  PythonOption PYTHON_EGG_CACHE /tmp \n  ...\n</Location>\n}}}\n\n=== Setting the !PythonPath\n\nIf the Trac installation isn\'t installed in your Python path, you will have to tell Apache where to find the Trac mod_python handler  using the `PythonPath` directive:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /projects/myproject>\n  ...\n  PythonPath \"sys.path + [\'/path/to/trac\']\"\n  ...\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nBe careful about using the !PythonPath directive, and \'\'not\'\' `SetEnv PYTHONPATH`, as the latter won\'t work.\n\n=== Setting up multiple projects\n\nThe Trac mod_python handler supports a configuration option similar to Subversion\'s `SvnParentPath`, called `TracEnvParentDir`:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /projects>\n  SetHandler mod_python\n  PythonInterpreter main_interpreter\n  PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend \n  PythonOption TracEnvParentDir /var/trac\n  PythonOption TracUriRoot /projects\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nWhen you request the `/projects` URL, you will get a listing of all subdirectories of the directory you set as `TracEnvParentDir` that look like Trac environment directories. Selecting any project in the list will bring you to the corresponding Trac environment.\n\nIf you don\'t want to have the subdirectory listing as your projects home page you can use a\n{{{#!apache\n<LocationMatch \"/.+/\">\n}}}\n\nThis will instruct Apache to use mod_python for all locations different from root while having the possibility of placing a custom home page for root in your !DocumentRoot folder.\n\nYou can also use the same authentication realm for all of the projects using a `<LocationMatch>` directive:\n{{{#!apache\n<LocationMatch \"/projects/[^/]+/login\">\n  AuthType Basic\n  AuthName \"Trac\"\n  AuthUserFile /var/trac/.htpasswd\n  Require valid-user\n</LocationMatch>\n}}}\n\n=== Virtual Host Configuration\n\nBelow is the sample configuration required to set up your Trac as a virtual server, ie when you access it at the URLs like\n`http://trac.mycompany.com`:\n\n{{{#!apache\n<VirtualHost *>\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/myproject\n    ServerName trac.mycompany.com\n    <Location />\n        SetHandler mod_python\n        PythonInterpreter main_interpreter\n        PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend\n        PythonOption TracEnv /var/trac/myproject\n        PythonOption TracUriRoot /\n    </Location>\n    <Location /login>\n        AuthType Basic\n        AuthName \"MyCompany Trac Server\"\n        AuthUserFile /var/trac/myproject/.htpasswd\n        Require valid-user\n    </Location>\n</VirtualHost>\n}}}\n\nThis does not seem to work in all cases. What you can do if it does not:\n * Try using `<LocationMatch>` instead of `<Location>`.\n * `<Location />` may, in your server setup, refer to the complete host instead of simple the root of the server. This means that everything (including the login directory referenced below) will be sent to Python and authentication does not work, ie you get the infamous Authentication information missing error. If this is the case, try using a sub-directory for Trac instead of the root, ie /web/ and /web/login instead of / and /login.\n * Depending on apache\'s `NameVirtualHost` configuration, you may need to use `<VirtualHost *:80>` instead of `<VirtualHost *>`.\n\nFor a virtual host that supports multiple projects replace `TracEnv /var/trac/myproject` with `TracEnvParentDir /var/trac`.\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': !DocumentRoot should not point to your Trac project env. As Asmodai wrote on #trac: \"suppose there\'s a webserver bug that allows disclosure of !DocumentRoot they could then leech the entire Trac environment\".\n\n== Troubleshooting\n\nIf you get server error pages, you can either check the Apache error log, or enable the `PythonDebug` option:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /projects/myproject>\n  ...\n  PythonDebug on\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nFor multiple projects, try restarting the server as well.\n\n=== Login Not Working\n\nIf you\'ve used `<Location />` directive, it will override any other directives, as well as `<Location /login>`.\nThe workaround is to use negation expression as follows (for multi project setups):\n{{{#!apache\n#this one for other pages\n<Location ~ \"/*(?!login)\">\n   SetHandler mod_python\n   PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend\n   PythonOption TracEnvParentDir /projects\n   PythonOption TracUriRoot /\n</Location>\n\n#this one for login page\n<Location ~ \"/[^/]+/login\">\n   SetHandler mod_python\n   PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend\n   PythonOption TracEnvParentDir /projects\n   PythonOption TracUriRoot /\n\n   #remove these if you don\'t want to force SSL\n   RewriteEngine On \n   RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\n   RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}\n\n   AuthType Basic\n   AuthName \"Trac\"\n   AuthUserFile /projects/.htpasswd\n   Require valid-user\n</Location>\n}}}\n\n=== Expat-related segmentation faults === #expat\n\nThis problem will most certainly hit you on Unix when using Python 2.4.\nIn Python 2.4, some version of [http://expat.sourceforge.net/ Expat] (an XML parser library written in C) is used and if Apache is using another version, this results in segmentation faults.\nAs Trac 0.11 is using Genshi, which will indirectly use Expat, that problem can now hit you even if everything was working fine before with Trac 0.10. This problem has not been reported for Python 2.5+, so best to upgrade.\n\n=== Form submission problems\n\nIf you\'re experiencing problems submitting some of the forms in Trac (a common problem is that you get redirected to the start page after submission), check whether your {{{DocumentRoot}}} contains a folder or file with the same path that you mapped the mod_python handler to. For some reason, mod_python gets confused when it is mapped to a location that also matches a static resource.\n\n=== Problem with virtual host configuration\n\nIf the <Location /> directive is used, setting the `DocumentRoot` may result in a \'\'403 (Forbidden)\'\' error. Either remove the `DocumentRoot` directive, or make sure that accessing the directory it points is allowed, in a corresponding `<Directory>` block.\n\nUsing <Location /> together with `SetHandler` resulted in having everything handled by mod_python, which leads to not being able to download any CSS or images/icons. Use <Location /trac> `SetHandler None` </Location> to circumvent the problem, though this may not be the most elegant solution.\n\n=== Problem with zipped egg\n\nIt\'s possible that your version of mod_python will not import modules from zipped eggs. If you encounter an `ImportError: No module named trac` in your Apache logs but you think everything is where it should be, this might be your problem. Look in your site-packages directory; if the Trac module appears as a \'\'file\'\' rather than a \'\'directory\'\', then this might be your problem. To rectify this, try installing Trac using the `--always-unzip` option:\n\n{{{#!sh\neasy_install --always-unzip Trac-0.12b1.zip\n}}}\n\n=== Using .htaccess\n\nAlthough it may seem trivial to rewrite the above configuration as a directory in your document root with a `.htaccess` file, this does not work. Apache will append a \"/\" to any Trac URLs, which interferes with its correct operation.\n\nIt may be possible to work around this with mod_rewrite, but I failed to get this working. In all, it is more hassle than it is worth.\n\nThis also works out-of-box, with following trivial config:\n{{{#!apache\nSetHandler mod_python\nPythonInterpreter main_interpreter\nPythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend \nPythonOption TracEnv /system/path/to/this/directory\nPythonOption TracUriRoot /path/on/apache\n\nAuthType Basic\nAuthName \"ProjectName\"\nAuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd\nRequire valid-user\n}}}\n\nThe `TracUriRoot` is obviously the path you need to enter to the browser to get to Trac, eg `domain.tld/projects/trac`.\n\n=== Additional .htaccess help\n\nIf you are using the .htaccess method you may have additional problems if your Trac directory is inheriting .htaccess directives from another. This may also help to add to your .htaccess file:\n\n{{{#!apache\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n  RewriteEngine Off\n</IfModule>\n}}}\n\n=== Platform specific issues\n==== Win32 Issues\n\nIf you run Trac with mod_python < 3.2 on Windows, uploading attachments will \'\'\'not\'\'\' work. This problem is resolved in mod_python 3.1.4 or later, so please upgrade mod_python to fix this.\n\n==== OS X issues\n\nWhen using mod_python on OS X you will not be able to restart Apache using `apachectl restart`. This is apparently fixed in mod_python 3.2, so please upgrade mod_python to fix this.\n\n==== SELinux issues\n\nIf Trac reports something like: `Cannot get shared lock on db.lock`, then the security context on the repository may need to be set:\n\n{{{#!sh\nchcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t PATH_TO_REPOSITORY\n}}}\n\nSee also [http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#reposperms How do I set repository permissions correctly?]\n\n==== FreeBSD issues\n\nThe FreeBSD ports have both the new and old versions of mod_python and SQLite, but earlier versions of pysqlite and mod_python won\'t integrate:\n * pysqlite requires threaded support in Python\n * mod_python requires a threadless install.\n\nApache2 does not automatically support threads on FreeBSD. You could force thread support when running `./configure` for Apache, using `--enable-threads`, but this isn´t recommended.\nThe best option [http://modpython.org/pipermail/mod_python/2006-September/021983.html seems to be] adding to /usr/local/apache2/bin/ennvars the line:\n\n{{{#!sh\nexport LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libc_r.so\n}}}\n\n==== Fedora 7 Issues\n\nMake sure you install the \'python-sqlite2\' package as it seems to be required for TracModPython, but not for tracd.\n\n=== Subversion issues\n\nIf you get the following Trac error `Unsupported version control system \"svn\"` only under mod_python, though it works well on the command-line and even with TracStandalone, chances are that you forgot to add the path to the Python bindings with the [TracModPython#ConfiguringPythonPath PythonPath] directive. A better way is to add a link to the bindings in the Python `site-packages` directory, or create a `.pth` file in that directory.\n\nIf this is not the case, it\'s possible that you are using Subversion libraries that are binary incompatible with the Apache ones and an incompatibility of the `apr` libraries is usually the cause. In that case, you also won\'t be able to use the svn modules for Apache (`mod_dav_svn`).\n\nYou also need a recent version of `mod_python` in order to avoid a runtime error ({{{argument number 2: a \'apr_pool_t *\' is expected}}}) due to the default usage of multiple sub-interpreters. Version 3.2.8 \'\'should\'\' work, though it\'s probably better to use the workaround described in [trac:#3371 #3371], in order to force the use of the main interpreter:\n{{{#!apache\nPythonInterpreter main_interpreter\n}}}\n\nThis is also the recommended workaround for other issues seen when using the Python bindings for Subversion within mod_python ([trac:#2611 #2611], [trac:#3455 #3455]). See in particular Graham Dumpleton\'s comment in [trac:comment:9:ticket:3455 #3455] explaining the issue.\n\n=== Page layout issues\n\nIf the formatting of the Trac pages look weird, chances are that the style sheets governing the page layout are not handled properly by the web server. Try adding the following lines to your Apache configuration:\n{{{#!apache\nAlias /myproject/css \"/usr/share/trac/htdocs/css\"\n<Location /myproject/css>\n    SetHandler None\n</Location>\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': For the above configuration to have any effect it must be put after the configuration of your project root location, ie {{{<Location /myproject />}}}.\n\n**Note:** Do not enable python optimizations using the directive `PythonOptimize On`. When optimizations are enabled the page header/footer and documentation for macros and plugins will be hidden. An error will be raised in Trac 1.0.11 and later when optimizations are enabled.\n\n=== HTTPS issues\n\nIf you want to run Trac fully under https you might find that it tries to redirect to plain http. In this case just add the following line to your Apache configuration:\n{{{#!apache\n<VirtualHost *>\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/myproject\n    ServerName trac.mycompany.com\n    SetEnv HTTPS 1\n    ....\n</VirtualHost>\n}}}\n\n=== Segmentation fault with php5-mhash or other php5 modules\n\nYou may encounter segfaults (reported on Debian etch) if php5-mhash module is installed. Try to remove it to see if this solves the problem. See [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411487 Debian bug report].\n\nSome people also have troubles when using PHP5 compiled with its own third party libraries instead of system libraries. Check [http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/#if-you-get-a-segmentation-fault Django segmentation fault].\n\n----\nSee also: TracGuide, TracInstall, [wiki:TracModWSGI ModWSGI], [wiki:TracFastCgi FastCGI], [trac:TracNginxRecipe]',NULL,NULL),('TracModWSGI',1,1629200947727170,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac and mod_wsgi\n\n[https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi mod_wsgi] is an Apache module for running WSGI-compatible Python applications directly on top of the Apache webserver. The mod_wsgi adapter is written completely in C and provides very good performance.\n\n[[PageOutline(2-3,Overview,inline)]]\n\n== The `trac.wsgi` script\n\nTrac can be run on top of mod_wsgi with the help of an application script, which is a Python file saved with a `.wsgi` extension. \n\nA robust and generic version of this file can be created using the `trac-admin <env> deploy <dir>` command which automatically substitutes the required paths, see TracInstall#cgi-bin. The script should be sufficient for most installations and users not wanting more information can proceed to [#Mappingrequeststothescript configuring Apache].\n\nIf you are using Trac with multiple projects, you can specify their common parent directory using the `TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR` in trac.wsgi:\n{{{#!python\ndef application(environ, start_request):\n    # Add this to config when you have multiple projects\n    environ.setdefault(\'trac.env_parent_dir\', \'/usr/share/trac/projects\')  \n    ..\n}}}\n\n=== A very basic script\n\nIn its simplest form, the script could be:\n\n{{{#!python\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\'TRAC_ENV\'] = \'/usr/local/trac/mysite\'\nos.environ[\'PYTHON_EGG_CACHE\'] = \'/usr/local/trac/mysite/eggs\'\n\nimport trac.web.main\napplication = trac.web.main.dispatch_request\n}}}\n\nThe `TRAC_ENV` variable should naturally be the directory for your Trac environment, and the `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` should be a directory where Python can temporarily extract Python eggs. If you have several Trac environments in a directory, you can also use `TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR` instead of `TRAC_ENV`.\n\nOn Windows:\n - If run under the user\'s session, the Python Egg cache can be found in `%AppData%\\Roaming`, for example:\n{{{#!python\nos.environ[\'PYTHON_EGG_CACHE\'] = r\'C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python-Eggs\'\n}}}\n - If run under a Window service, you should create a directory for Python Egg cache:\n{{{#!python\nos.environ[\'PYTHON_EGG_CACHE\'] = r\'C:\\Trac-Python-Eggs\'\n}}}\n\n=== A more elaborate script\n\nIf you are using multiple `.wsgi` files (for example one per Trac environment) you must \'\'not\'\' use `os.environ[\'TRAC_ENV\']` to set the path to the Trac environment. Using this method may lead to Trac delivering the content of another Trac environment, as the variable may be filled with the path of a previously viewed Trac environment. \n\nTo solve this problem, use the following `.wsgi` file instead:\n{{{#!python\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\'PYTHON_EGG_CACHE\'] = \'/usr/local/trac/mysite/eggs\'\n\nimport trac.web.main\ndef application(environ, start_response):\n  environ[\'trac.env_path\'] = \'/usr/local/trac/mysite\' \n  return trac.web.main.dispatch_request(environ, start_response)\n}}}\n\nFor clarity, you should give this file a `.wsgi` extension. You should probably put the file in its own directory, since you will expose it to Apache. \n\nIf you have installed Trac and Python eggs in a path different from the standard one, you should add that path by adding the following code at the top of the wsgi script:\n\n{{{#!python\nimport site\nsite.addsitedir(\'/usr/local/trac/lib/python2.4/site-packages\')\n}}}\n\nChange it according to the path you installed the Trac libs at.\n\n== Mapping requests to the script\n\nAfter preparing your .wsgi script, add the following to your Apache configuration file, typically `httpd.conf`:\n\n{{{#!apache\nWSGIScriptAlias /trac /usr/local/trac/mysite/apache/mysite.wsgi\n\n<Directory /usr/local/trac/mysite/apache>\n    WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}\n    # For Apache 2.2\n    <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>\n        Order deny,allow\n        Allow from all\n    </IfModule>\n    # For Apache 2.4\n    <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>\n        Require all granted\n    </IfModule>\n</Directory>\n}}}\n\nHere, the script is in a subdirectory of the Trac environment.\n\nIf you followed the directions [TracInstall#cgi-bin Generating the Trac cgi-bin directory], your Apache configuration file should look like following:\n\n{{{#!apache\nWSGIScriptAlias /trac /usr/share/trac/cgi-bin/trac.wsgi\n\n<Directory /usr/share/trac/cgi-bin>\n    WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}\n    # For Apache 2.2\n    <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>\n        Order deny,allow\n        Allow from all\n    </IfModule>\n    # For Apache 2.4\n    <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>\n        Require all granted\n    </IfModule>\n</Directory>\n}}}\n\nIn order to let Apache run the script, access to the directory in which the script resides is opened up to all of Apache. Additionally, the `WSGIApplicationGroup` directive ensures that Trac is always run in the first Python interpreter created by mod_wsgi. This is necessary because the Subversion Python bindings, which are used by Trac, don\'t always work in other sub-interpreters and may cause requests to hang or cause Apache to crash. After adding this configuration, restart Apache, and then it should work.\n\nTo test the setup of Apache, mod_wsgi and Python itself (ie without involving Trac and dependencies), this simple wsgi application can be used to make sure that requests gets served (use as only content in your `.wsgi` script):\n\n{{{#!python\ndef application(environ, start_response):\n        start_response(\'200 OK\',[(\'Content-type\',\'text/html\')])\n        return [\'<html><body>Hello World!</body></html>\']\n}}}\n\nFor more information about using the mod_wsgi specific directives, see the [https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/wikis mod_wsgi\'s wiki] and more specifically the [https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/wikis/IntegrationWithTrac.wiki IntegrationWithTrac] page.\n\n== Configuring Authentication\n\nThe following sections describe different methods for setting up authentication. See also [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/auth.html Authentication, Authorization and Access Control] in the Apache guide.\n\n=== Using Basic Authentication\n\nThe simplest way to enable authentication with Apache is to create a password file. Use the `htpasswd` program as follows:\n{{{#!sh\n$ htpasswd -c /somewhere/trac.htpasswd admin\nNew password: <type password>\nRe-type new password: <type password again>\nAdding password for user admin\n}}}\n\nAfter the first user, you don\'t need the \"-c\" option anymore:\n{{{#!sh\n$ htpasswd /somewhere/trac.htpasswd john\nNew password: <type password>\nRe-type new password: <type password again>\nAdding password for user john\n}}}\n\nSee the man page for `htpasswd` for full documentation.\n\nAfter you\'ve created the users, you can set their permissions using TracPermissions.\n\nNow, you need to enable authentication against the password file in the Apache configuration:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location \"/trac/login\">\n  AuthType Basic\n  AuthName \"Trac\"\n  AuthUserFile /somewhere/trac.htpasswd\n  Require valid-user\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nIf you are hosting multiple projects, you can use the same password file for all of them:\n{{{#!apache\n<LocationMatch \"/trac/[^/]+/login\">\n  AuthType Basic\n  AuthName \"Trac\"\n  AuthUserFile /somewhere/trac.htpasswd\n  Require valid-user\n</LocationMatch>\n}}}\n\nNote that neither a file nor a directory named \'login\' needs to exist. See also the [https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_auth_basic.html mod_auth_basic] documentation.\n\n=== Using Digest Authentication\n\nFor better security, it is recommended that you either enable SSL or at least use the \"digest\" authentication scheme instead of \"Basic\".\n\nYou have to create your `.htpasswd` file with the `htdigest` command instead of `htpasswd`, as follows:\n{{{#!sh\n$ htdigest -c /somewhere/trac.htpasswd trac admin\n}}}\n\nThe \"trac\" parameter above is the \"realm\", and will have to be reused in the Apache configuration in the !AuthName directive:\n\n{{{#!apache\n<Location \"/trac/login\">\n  AuthType Digest\n  AuthName \"trac\"\n  AuthDigestDomain /trac\n  AuthUserFile /somewhere/trac.htpasswd\n  Require valid-user\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nFor multiple environments, you can use the same `LocationMatch` as described with the previous method.\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': `Location` cannot be used inside .htaccess files, but must instead live within the main httpd.conf file. If you are on a shared server, you therefore will not be able to provide this level of granularity.\n\nDon\'t forget to activate the mod_auth_digest. For example, on a Debian 4.0r1 (etch) system:\n{{{#!apache\n  LoadModule auth_digest_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_auth_digest.so\n}}}\n\nSee also the [https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_auth_basic.html mod_auth_digest] documentation.\n\n=== Using LDAP Authentication \n\nConfiguration for [https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ldap.html mod_ldap] authentication in Apache is more involved (httpd 2.2+ and OpenLDAP: slapd 2.3.19).\n\n1. You need to load the following modules in Apache httpd.conf:\n{{{#!apache\n  LoadModule ldap_module modules/mod_ldap.so\n  LoadModule authnz_ldap_module modules/mod_authnz_ldap.so\n}}}\n1. Your httpd.conf also needs to look something like:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /trac/>\n  # (if you\'re using it, mod_python specific settings go here)\n  Order deny,allow\n  Deny from all\n  Allow from 192.168.11.0/24\n  AuthType Basic\n  AuthName \"Trac\"\n  AuthBasicProvider \"ldap\"\n  AuthLDAPURL \"ldap://127.0.0.1/dc=example,dc=co,dc=ke?uid?sub?(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)\"\n  authzldapauthoritative Off\n  Require valid-user\n</Location>\n}}}\n1. You can use the LDAP interface as a way to authenticate to a Microsoft Active Directory. Use the following as your LDAP URL:\n{{{#!apache\n  AuthLDAPURL \"ldap://directory.example.com:3268/DC=example,DC=com?sAMAccountName?sub?(objectClass=user)\"\n}}}\n You will also need to provide an account for Apache to use when checking credentials. As this password will be listed in plain text in the configuration, you need to use an account specifically for this task:\n{{{#!apache\n  AuthLDAPBindDN ldap-auth-user@example.com\n  AuthLDAPBindPassword \"password\"\n}}}\n The whole section looks like:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /trac/>\n  # (if you\'re using it, mod_python specific settings go here)\n  Order deny,allow\n  Deny from all\n  Allow from 192.168.11.0/24\n  AuthType Basic\n  AuthName \"Trac\"\n  AuthBasicProvider \"ldap\"\n  AuthLDAPURL \"ldap://adserver.company.com:3268/DC=company,DC=com?sAMAccountName?sub?(objectClass=user)\"\n  AuthLDAPBindDN       ldap-auth-user@company.com\n  AuthLDAPBindPassword \"the_password\"\n  authzldapauthoritative Off\n  # require valid-user\n  Require ldap-group CN=Trac Users,CN=Users,DC=company,DC=com\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nNote 1: This is the case where the LDAP search will get around the multiple OUs, conecting to the Global Catalog Server portion of AD. Note the port is 3268, not the normal LDAP 389. The GCS is basically a \"flattened\" tree which allows searching for a user without knowing to which OU they belong.\n\nNote 2: You can also require the user be a member of a certain LDAP group, instead of just having a valid login:\n{{{#!apache\n  Require ldap-group CN=Trac Users,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com\n}}}\n\nSee also:\n - [https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authnz_ldap.html mod_authnz_ldap], documentation for mod_authnz_ldap.   \n - [https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ldap.html mod_ldap], documentation for mod_ldap, which provides connection pooling and a shared cache.\n - [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/LdapPlugin TracHacks:LdapPlugin] for storing TracPermissions in LDAP.\n\n=== Using SSPI Authentication\n\nIf you are using Apache on Windows, you can use mod_auth_sspi to provide single-sign-on. Download the module from the !SourceForge [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-auth-sspi/ mod-auth-sspi project] and then add the following to your !VirtualHost:\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /trac/login>\n  AuthType SSPI\n  AuthName \"Trac Login\"\n  SSPIAuth On\n  SSPIAuthoritative On\n  SSPIDomain MyLocalDomain\n  SSPIOfferBasic On\n  SSPIOmitDomain Off\n  SSPIBasicPreferred On\n  Require valid-user\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nUsing the above, usernames in Trac will be of the form `DOMAIN\\username`, so you may have to re-add permissions and such. If you do not want the domain to be part of the username, set `SSPIOmitDomain On` instead.\n\nSome common problems with SSPI authentication: [trac:#1055], [trac:#1168] and [trac:#3338].\n\nSee also [trac:TracOnWindows/Advanced].\n\n=== Using CA !SiteMinder Authentication\n\nSetup CA !SiteMinder to protect your Trac login URL, for example `/trac/login`. Also, make sure the policy is set to include the HTTP_REMOTE_USER variable. If your site allows it, you can set this in `LocalConfig.conf`:\n{{{#!apache\nRemoteUserVar=\"WHATEVER_IT_SHOULD_BE\"\nSetRemoteUser=\"YES\"\n}}}\n\nThe specific variable is site-dependent. Ask your site administrator. If your site does not allow the use of `LocalConfig.conf` for security reasons, have your site administrator set the policy on the server to set REMOTE_USER.\n\nAlso add a !LogOffUri parameter to the agent configuration, for example `/trac/logout`.\n\nThen modify the trac.wsgi script generated using `trac-admin <env> deploy <dir>` to add the following lines, which extract the `HTTP_REMOTE_USER` variable and set it to `REMOTE_USER`:\n\n{{{#!python\ndef application(environ, start_request): \n    # Set authenticated username on CA SiteMinder to REMOTE_USER variable \n    # strip() is used to remove any spaces on the end of the string\n    if \'HTTP_SM_USER\' in environ: \n        environ[\'REMOTE_USER\'] = environ[\'HTTP_REMOTE_USER\'].strip()\n    ...\n}}}\n\nYou do not need any Apache \"Location\" directives.\n\n=== Example: Apache/mod_wsgi with Basic Authentication, Trac being at the root of a virtual host\n\nPer the mod_wsgi documentation linked to above, here is an example Apache configuration that:\n - serves the Trac instance from a virtualhost subdomain\n - uses Apache basic authentication for Trac authentication.\n\nIf you want your Trac to be served from eg !http://trac.my-proj.my-site.org, then from the folder eg `/home/trac-for-my-proj`, if you used the command `trac-admin the-env initenv` to create a folder `the-env`, and you used `trac-admin the-env deploy the-deploy` to create a folder `the-deploy`, then first:\n\nCreate the htpasswd file:\n{{{#!sh\ncd /home/trac-for-my-proj/the-env\nhtpasswd -c htpasswd firstuser\n### and add more users to it as needed:\nhtpasswd htpasswd seconduser\n}}}\n\nKeep the file above your document root for security reasons.\n\nCreate this file for example `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/trac.my-proj.my-site.org.conf` on Ubuntu with the following content:\n\n{{{#!apache\n<Directory /home/trac-for-my-proj/the-deploy/cgi-bin/trac.wsgi>\n  WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}\n  Order deny,allow\n  Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  ServerName trac.my-proj.my-site.org\n  DocumentRoot /home/trac-for-my-proj/the-env/htdocs/\n  WSGIScriptAlias / /home/trac-for-my-proj/the-deploy/cgi-bin/trac.wsgi\n  <Location \'/\'>\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthName \"Trac\"\n    AuthUserFile /home/trac-for-my-proj/the-env/htpasswd\n    Require valid-user\n  </Location>\n</VirtualHost>\n\n}}}\n\nFor subdomains to work you would probably also need to alter `/etc/hosts` and add A-Records to your host\'s DNS.\n\n== Troubleshooting\n\n=== Use a recent version\n\nPlease use either version 1.6, 2.4 or later of `mod_wsgi`. Versions prior to 2.4 in the 2.X branch have problems with some Apache configurations that use WSGI file wrapper extension. This extension is used in Trac to serve up attachments and static media files such as style sheets. If you are affected by this problem, attachments will appear to be empty and formatting of HTML pages will appear not to work due to style sheet files not loading properly. Another frequent symptom is that binary attachment downloads are truncated. See mod_wsgi tickets [https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/issues/100 #100] and [https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/issues/132 #132].\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': using mod_wsgi 2.5 and Python 2.6.1 gave an Internal Server Error on my system (Apache 2.2.11 and Trac 0.11.2.1). Upgrading to Python 2.6.2 (as suggested [http://www.mail-archive.com/modwsgi@googlegroups.com/msg01917.html here]) solved this for me[[BR]]-- Graham Shanks\n\nIf you plan to use `mod_wsgi` in embedded mode on Windows or with the MPM worker on Linux, then you will need version 3.4 or greater. See [trac:#10675] for details.\n\n=== Getting Trac to work nicely with SSPI and \'Require Group\'\n\nIf you have set Trac up on Apache, Win32 and configured SSPI, but added a \'Require group\' option to your Apache configuration, then the SSPIOmitDomain option is probably not working. If it is not working, your usernames in Trac probably look like \'DOMAIN\\user\' rather than \'user\'.\n\nThis WSGI script fixes that:\n{{{#!python\nimport os\nimport trac.web.main\n\nos.environ[\'TRAC_ENV\'] = \'/usr/local/trac/mysite\'\nos.environ[\'PYTHON_EGG_CACHE\'] = \'/usr/local/trac/mysite/eggs\'\n\ndef application(environ, start_response):\n    if \"\\\\\" in environ[\'REMOTE_USER\']:\n        environ[\'REMOTE_USER\'] = environ[\'REMOTE_USER\'].split(\"\\\\\", 1)[1]\n    return trac.web.main.dispatch_request(environ, start_response)\n}}}\n\n=== Trac with PostgreSQL\n\nWhen using the mod_wsgi adapter with multiple Trac instances and PostgreSQL (or MySQL?) as the database, the server \'\'may\'\' create a lot of open database connections and thus PostgreSQL processes.\n\nA somewhat brutal workaround is to disable connection pooling in Trac. This is done by setting `poolable = False` in `trac.db.postgres_backend` on the `PostgreSQLConnection` class.\n\nBut it is not necessary to edit the source of Trac. The following lines in `trac.wsgi` will also work:\n\n{{{#!python\nimport trac.db.postgres_backend\ntrac.db.postgres_backend.PostgreSQLConnection.poolable = False\n}}}\n\nor\n\n{{{#!python\nimport trac.db.mysql_backend\ntrac.db.mysql_backend.MySQLConnection.poolable = False\n}}}\n\nNow Trac drops the connection after serving a page and the connection count on the database will be kept low.\n\n//This is not a recommended approach though. See also the notes at the bottom of the [https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/wikis/IntegrationWithTrac.wiki mod_wsgi\'s IntegrationWithTrac] wiki page.//\n\n=== Missing Headers and Footers\n\nIf python optimizations are enabled, then headers and footers will not be rendered. An error will be raised in Trac 1.0.11 and later when optimizations are enabled.\n\nIn your WSGI configuration file, the `WSGIPythonOptimize` setting must be set to `0` (`1` or `2` will not work):\n\n{{{#!apache\n    WSGIPythonOptimize 0\n}}}\n\nOn Ubuntu, the WSGI mod configuration is at `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/wsgi.conf`.\n\nThe same issue is seen with `PythonOptimize On` in [TracModPython#Pagelayoutissues ModPython].\n\n=== Other resources\n\nFor more troubleshooting tips, see also the [TracModPython#Troubleshooting mod_python troubleshooting] section, as most Apache-related issues are quite similar, plus discussion of potential [https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/wikis/ApplicationIssues.wiki application issues] when using mod_wsgi. The wsgi page also has a [https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/wikis/IntegrationWithTrac.wiki Integration With Trac] document.\n\n----\nSee also: TracGuide, TracInstall, [wiki:TracFastCgi FastCGI], [wiki:TracModPython ModPython], [trac:TracNginxRecipe TracNginxRecipe]',NULL,NULL),('TracNavigation',1,1629200947598574,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac Navigation\n\nThe main and meta navigation entries can be customized in some basic ways. The `[mainnav]` and `[metanav]` configuration sections can be used to customize the text and link used for the navigation items, or even to disable them. The `mainnav` and `metanav` options in the `[trac]` configuration section can be used to change the order.\n\n=== `[mainnav]` #mainnav-bar\n\n`[mainnav]` corresponds to the \'\'\'main navigation bar\'\'\', the one containing entries such as \'\'Wiki\'\', \'\'Timeline\'\', \'\'Roadmap\'\', \'\'Browse Source\'\' and so on. This navigation bar is meant to access the default page of the main modules enabled in Trac that are accessible for the current user.\n\n** [=#Example Example] ** \n\nIn the following example we rename the link to the Wiki start \"Home\", and make the \"View Tickets\" entry link to a specific report.

For example, this is how the [http://lists.edgewall.com/archive/trac-tickets/ Trac-tickets] mailing list is set up.\n\nDisabled by default, notification can be activated and configured in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini].\n\n== Receiving Notification Mails\n\nWhen reporting a new ticket or adding a comment, enter a valid email address or your Trac username in the \'\'reporter\'\', \'\'assigned to/owner\'\' or \'\'cc\'\' field. Trac will automatically send you an email when changes are made to the ticket, depending on how notification is configured.\n\n=== How to use your username to receive notification mails\n\nTo receive notification mails, you can either enter a full email address or your Trac username. To get notified with a simple username or login, you need to specify a valid email address in the \'\'Preferences\'\' page. \n\nAlternatively, a default domain name (\'\'\'`smtp_default_domain`\'\'\') can be set in the TracIni file, see [#ConfigurationOptions Configuration Options] below. In this case, the default domain will be appended to the username, which can be useful for an \"Intranet\" kind of installation.\n\nWhen using apache and mod_kerb for authentication against Kerberos / Active Directory, usernames take the form (\'\'\'`username@EXAMPLE.LOCAL`\'\'\'). To avoid this being interpreted as an email address, add the Kerberos domain to  (\'\'\'`ignore_domains`\'\'\').\n\n=== Ticket attachment notifications\n\nSince 1.0.3 Trac will send notifications when a ticket attachment is added or deleted. Usually attachment notifications will be enabled in an environment by default. To disable the attachment notifications for an environment the `TicketAttachmentNotifier` component must be disabled:\n{{{#!ini\n[components]\ntrac.ticket.notification.TicketAttachmentNotifier = disabled\n}}}\n\n== Configuring SMTP Notification\n\n\'\'\'Important:\'\'\' For TracNotification to work correctly, the `[trac] base_url` option must be set in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini]. \n\n=== Configuration Options\n\nThese are the available options for the `[notification]` section in `trac.ini`:\n\n[[TracIni(notification)]]\n\n=== Example Configuration (SMTP)\n\n{{{#!ini\n[notification]\nsmtp_enabled = true\nsmtp_server = mail.example.com\nsmtp_from = notifier@example.com\nsmtp_replyto = myproj@projects.example.com\nsmtp_always_cc = ticketmaster@example.com, theboss+myproj@example.com\n}}}\n\n=== Example Configuration (`sendmail`)\n\n{{{#!ini\n[notification]\nsmtp_enabled = true\nemail_sender = SendmailEmailSender\nsendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail\nsmtp_from = notifier@example.com\nsmtp_replyto = myproj@projects.example.com\nsmtp_always_cc = ticketmaster@example.com, theboss+myproj@example.com\n}}}\n\n=== Customizing the e-mail subject\n\nThe e-mail subject can be customized with the `ticket_subject_template` option, which contains a [http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/text-templates.html Genshi text template] snippet. The default value is:\n{{{\n$prefix #$ticket.id: $summary\n}}}\n\nThe following variables are available in the template:\n\n * `env`: The project environment (see [trac:source:/trunk/trac/env.py env.py]).\n * `prefix`: The prefix defined in `smtp_subject_prefix`.\n * `summary`: The ticket summary, with the old value if the summary was edited.\n * `ticket`: The ticket model object (see [trac:source:/trunk/trac/ticket/model.py model.py]). Individual ticket fields can be addressed by appending the field name separated by a dot, eg `$ticket.milestone`.\n\n=== Customizing the e-mail content\n\nThe notification e-mail content is generated based on `ticket_notify_email.txt` in `trac/ticket/templates`. You can add your own version of this template by adding a `ticket_notify_email.txt` to the templates directory of your environment. The default looks like this:\n\n{{{\n$ticket_body_hdr\n$ticket_props\n{% choose ticket.new %}\\\n{%   when True %}\\\n$ticket.description\n{%   end %}\\\n{%   otherwise %}\\\n{%     if changes_body %}\\\n${_(\'Changes (by %(author)s):\', author=change.author)}\n\n$changes_body\n{%     end %}\\\n{%     if changes_descr %}\\\n{%       if not changes_body and not change.comment and change.author %}\\\n${_(\'Description changed by %(author)s:\', author=change.author)}\n{%       end %}\\\n$changes_descr\n--\n{%     end %}\\\n{%     if change.comment %}\\\n\n${changes_body and _(\'Comment:\') or _(\'Comment (by %(author)s):\', author=change.author)}\n\n$change.comment\n{%     end %}\\\n{%   end %}\\\n{% end %}\\\n\n-- \n${_(\'Ticket URL: <%(link)s>\', link=ticket.link)}\n$project.name <${project.url or abs_href()}>\n$project.descr\n}}}\n\n== Sample Email\n\n{{{\n#42: testing\n---------------------------+------------------------------------------------\n       Id:  42             |      Status:  assigned                \nComponent:  report system  |    Modified:  Fri Apr  9 00:04:31 2004\n Severity:  major          |   Milestone:  0.9                     \n Priority:  lowest         |     Version:  0.6                     \n    Owner:  anonymous      |    Reporter:  jonas@example.com               \n---------------------------+------------------------------------------------\nChanges:\n  * component:  changeset view => search system\n  * priority:  low => highest\n  * owner:  jonas => anonymous\n  * cc:  daniel@example.com =>\n         daniel@example.com, jonas@example.com\n  * status:  new => assigned\n\nComment:\nI\'m interested too!\n\n--\nTicket URL: <http://example.com/trac/ticket/42>\nMy Project <http://myproj.example.com/>\n}}}\n\n== Customizing e-mail content for MS Outlook\n\nMS Outlook normally presents plain text e-mails with a variable-width font, and as a result the ticket properties table will most certainly look like a mess in MS Outlook. This can be fixed with some customization of the [#Customizingthee-mailcontent e-mail template].\n\nReplace the following second row in the template:\n{{{\n$ticket_props\n}}}\n\nwith this (requires Python 2.6 or later):\n{{{\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{% with\n   pv = [(a[0].strip(), a[1].strip()) for a in [b.split(\':\') for b in\n         [c.strip() for c in \n          ticket_props.replace(\'|\', \'\\n\').splitlines()[1:-1]] if \':\' in b]];\n   sel = [\'Reporter\', \'Owner\', \'Type\', \'Status\', \'Priority\', \'Milestone\', \n          \'Component\', \'Severity\', \'Resolution\', \'Keywords\'] %}\\\n${\'\\n\'.join(\'%s\\t%s\' % (format(p[0]+\':\', \' <12\'), p[1]) for p in pv if p[0] in sel)}\n{% end %}\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n}}}\n\nThe table of ticket properties is replaced with a list of a selection of the properties. A tab character separates the name and value in such a way that most people should find this more pleasing than the default table when using MS Outlook.\n{{{#!div style=\"margin: 1em 1.75em; border:1px dotted\"\n{{{#!html\n#42: testing<br />\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />\n<table cellpadding=0>\n<tr><td>Reporter:</td><td>jonas@example.com</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Owner:</td><td>anonymous</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Type:</td><td>defect</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Status:</td><td>assigned</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Priority:</td><td>lowest</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Milestone:</td><td>0.9</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Component:</td><td>report system</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Severity:</td><td>major</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Resolution:</td><td> </td></tr>\n<tr><td>Keywords:</td><td> </td></tr>\n</table>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />\nChanges:<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* component: &nbsp;changeset view =&gt; search system<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* priority: &nbsp;low =&gt; highest<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* owner: &nbsp;jonas =&gt; anonymous<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* cc: &nbsp;daniel@example.com =&gt;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daniel@example.com, jonas@example.com<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;* status: &nbsp;new =&gt; assigned<br />\n<br />\nComment:<br />\nI\'m interested too!<br />\n<br />\n--<br />\nTicket URL: &lt;http://example.com/trac/ticket/42&gt;<br />\nMy Project &lt;http://myproj.example.com/&gt;<br />\n}}}\n}}}\n\n**Important**: Only those ticket fields that are listed in `sel` are part of the HTML mail. If you have defined custom ticket fields which are to be part of the mail, then they have to be added to `sel`. Example:\n{{{\n   sel = [\'Reporter\', ..., \'Keywords\', \'Custom1\', \'Custom2\']\n}}}\n\nHowever, the solution is still a workaround to an automatically HTML-formatted e-mail.\n\n== Using GMail as the SMTP relay host\n\nUse the following configuration snippet:\n{{{#!ini\n[notification]\nsmtp_enabled = true\nuse_tls = true\nmime_encoding = base64\nsmtp_server = smtp.gmail.com\nsmtp_port = 587\nsmtp_user = user\nsmtp_password = password\n}}}\n\nwhere \'\'user\'\' and \'\'password\'\' match an existing GMail account, ie the ones you use to log in on [http://gmail.com].\n\nAlternatively, you can use `smtp_port = 25`.[[br]]\nYou should not use `smtp_port = 465`. Doing so may deadlock your ticket submission. Port 465 is reserved for the SMTPS protocol, which is not supported by Trac. See [trac:comment:2:ticket:7107 #7107] for details.\n \n== Filtering notifications for one\'s own changes and comments\n\nTo delete these notifications in Gmail, use the following filter:\n{{{\nfrom:(<smtp_from>) ((\"Reporter: <username>\" -Changes -Comment) OR \"Changes (by <username>)\" OR \"Comment (by <username>)\")\n}}}\n\nIn Thunderbird, there is no such solution if you use IMAP, see http://kb.mozillazine.org/Filters_(Thunderbird)#Filtering_the_message_body.\n\nYou can also add this plugin:\nhttp://trac-hacks.org/wiki/NeverNotifyUpdaterPlugin, or vote for [trac:#2247] to be fixed.\n\n== Troubleshooting\n\nIf you cannot get the notification working, first make sure the log is activated and have a look at the log to find if an error message has been logged. See TracLogging for help about the log feature.\n\nNotification errors are not reported through the web interface, so the user who submits a change or a new ticket never gets notified about a notification failure. The Trac administrator needs to look at the log to find the error trace.\n\n=== \'\'Permission denied\'\' error\n\nTypical error message:\n{{{\n  ...\n  File \".../smtplib.py\", line 303, in connect\n    raise socket.error, msg\n  error: (13, \'Permission denied\')\n}}}\n\nThis error usually comes from a security settings on the server: many Linux distributions do not allow the web server (Apache, ...) to post email messages to the local SMTP server.\n\nMany users get confused when their manual attempts to contact the SMTP server succeed:\n{{{#!sh\ntelnet localhost 25\n}}}\n\nThis is because a regular user may connect to the SMTP server, but the web server cannot:\n{{{#!sh\nsudo -u www-data telnet localhost 25\n}}}\n\nIn such a case, you need to configure your server so that the web server is authorized to post to the SMTP server. The actual settings depend on your Linux distribution and current security policy. You may find help in the Trac [trac:MailingList MailingList] archive.\n\nRelevant mailing list thread on SELinux: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.trac.general/7518\n\nFor SELinux in Fedora 10:\n{{{#!sh\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1\n}}}\n\n=== \'\'Suspected spam\'\' error\n\nSome SMTP servers may reject the notification email sent by Trac.\n\nThe default Trac configuration uses Base64 encoding to send emails to the recipients. The whole body of the email is encoded, which sometimes trigger \'\'false positive\'\' spam detection on sensitive email servers. In such an event, change the default encoding to \"quoted-printable\" using the `mime_encoding` option.\n\nQuoted printable encoding works better with languages that use one of the Latin charsets. For Asian charsets, stick with the Base64 encoding.\n\n----\nSee also: TracTickets, TracIni, TracGuide, [trac:TracDev/NotificationApi]',NULL,NULL),('TracPermissions',1,1629200947575342,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac Permissions\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nTrac uses a simple, case sensitive, permission system to control what users can and can\'t access.\n\nPermission privileges are managed using the [TracAdmin trac-admin] tool or the \'\'General / Permissions\'\' panel in the \'\'Admin\'\' tab of the web interface.\n\nIn addition to the default permission policy described in this page, it is possible to activate additional permission policies by enabling plugins and listing them in the `[trac] permission_policies` configuration entry in the TracIni. See TracFineGrainedPermissions for more details.\n\nNon-authenticated users accessing the system are assigned the name \"anonymous\". Assign permissions to the \"anonymous\" user to set privileges for anonymous/guest users. The parts of Trac that a user does not have the privileges for will not be displayed in the navigation.\nIn addition to these privileges, users can be granted additional individual rights in effect when authenticated and logged into the system. All logged in users belong to the virtual group \"authenticated\", which inherits permissions from \"anonymous\".\n\n== Graphical Admin Tab\n\nTo access this tab, a user must have one of the following permissions: `TRAC_ADMIN`, `PERMISSION_ADMIN`, `PERMISSION_GRANT`, `PERMISSION_REVOKE`. The permissions can be granted using the `trac-admin` command (more on `trac-admin` below):\n{{{\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob TRAC_ADMIN\n}}}\n\nThen, the user `bob` will be able to see the Admin tab, and can then access the permissions menu. This menu will allow you to perform all the following actions, but from the browser without requiring root access to the server (just the correct permissions for your user account). \'\'\'Use at least one lowercase character in user names, as all-uppercase names are reserved for permissions.\'\'\'\n\n 1.

[[Image(htdocs:../common/guide/admin-permissions-TICKET_ADMIN.png)]]\n\nAn easy way to quickly secure a new Trac install is to run the above command on the anonymous user, install the [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin AccountManagerPlugin], create a new admin account graphically and then remove the TRAC_ADMIN permission from the anonymous user.\n\nFrom the graphical admin tab, users with `PERMISSION_GRANT` will only be allowed to grant permissions that they possess, and users with `PERMISSION_REVOKE` will only be allowed to revoke permissions that they possess. For example, a user cannot grant `MILESTONE_ADMIN` unless they have `PERMISSION_GRANT` and `MILESTONE_ADMIN`, and they cannot revoke `MILESTONE_ADMIN` unless they have `PERMISSION_REVOKE` and `MILESTONE_ADMIN`. `PERMISSION_ADMIN` just grants the user both `PERMISSION_GRANT` and `PERMISSION_REVOKE`, and users with `TRAC_ADMIN` can grant or revoke any permission.\n\n== Available Privileges\n\nTo enable all privileges for a user, use the `TRAC_ADMIN` permission. Having `TRAC_ADMIN` is like being `root` on a *NIX system: it will allow you to perform any operation.\n\nOtherwise, individual privileges can be assigned to users for the various different functional areas of Trac (\'\'\'note that the privilege names are case-sensitive\'\'\'):\n\n=== Repository Browser\n\n|| `BROWSER_VIEW` || View directory listings in the [wiki:TracBrowser repository browser] ||\n|| `LOG_VIEW` || View revision logs of files and directories in the [wiki:TracBrowser repository browser] ||\n|| `FILE_VIEW` || View files in the [wiki:TracBrowser repository browser] ||\n|| `CHANGESET_VIEW` || View [wiki:TracChangeset repository check-ins] ||\n\n=== Ticket System\n\n|| `TICKET_VIEW` || View existing [wiki:TracTickets tickets] and perform [wiki:TracQuery ticket queries] ||\n|| `TICKET_CREATE` || Create new [wiki:TracTickets tickets] ||\n|| `TICKET_APPEND` || Add comments or attachments to [wiki:TracTickets tickets] ||\n|| `TICKET_CHGPROP` || Modify [wiki:TracTickets ticket] properties (priority, assignment, keywords, etc.) with the following exceptions: edit description field, add/remove other users from cc field when logged in, and set email to pref ||\n|| `TICKET_MODIFY` || Includes both `TICKET_APPEND` and `TICKET_CHGPROP`, and in addition allows resolving [wiki:TracTickets tickets].

For more information, please refer to the documentation  on the [wiki:TracIni#extra-permissions-section TracIni] page after enabling the component.\n\n== Granting Privileges\n\nYou grant privileges to users using [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin]. The current set of privileges can be listed with the following command:\n{{{\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission list\n}}}\n\nThis command will allow the user \'\'bob\'\' to delete reports:\n{{{\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob REPORT_DELETE\n}}}\n\nThe `permission add` command also accepts multiple privilege names:\n{{{\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob REPORT_DELETE WIKI_CREATE\n}}}\n\nOr add all privileges:\n{{{\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob TRAC_ADMIN\n}}}\n\n== Permission Groups\n\nThere are two built-in groups, \"authenticated\" and \"anonymous\".\nAny user who has not logged in is automatically in the \"anonymous\" group.\nAny user who has logged in is also in the \"authenticated\" group.\nThe \"authenticated\" group inherits permissions from the \"anonymous\" group.\nFor example, if the \"anonymous\" group has permission WIKI_MODIFY, \nit is not necessary to add the WIKI_MODIFY permission to the \"authenticated\" group as well.\n\nCustom groups may be defined that inherit permissions from the two built-in groups.\n\nPermissions can be grouped together to form roles such as \'\'developer\'\', \'\'admin\'\', etc.\n{{{\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add developer WIKI_ADMIN\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add developer REPORT_ADMIN\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add developer TICKET_MODIFY\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob developer\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add john developer\n}}}\n\nGroup membership can be checked by doing a {{{permission list}}} with no further arguments; the resulting output will include group memberships. \'\'\'Use at least one lowercase character in group names, as all-uppercase names are reserved for permissions\'\'\'.\n\n== Adding a New Group and Permissions\nPermission groups can be created by assigning a user to a group you wish to create, then assign permissions to that group.\n\nThe following will add \'\'bob\'\' to the new group called \'\'beta_testers\'\' and then will assign WIKI_ADMIN permissions to that group. (Thus, \'\'bob\'\' will inherit the WIKI_ADMIN permission)\n{{{ \n   $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob beta_testers\n   $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add beta_testers WIKI_ADMIN\n\n}}}\n\n== Removing Permissions\n\nPermissions can be removed using the \'remove\' command. For example:\n\nThis command will prevent the user \'\'bob\'\' from deleting reports:\n{{{\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission remove bob REPORT_DELETE\n}}}\n\nJust like `permission add`, this command accepts multiple privilege names.\n\nYou can also remove all privileges for a specific user:\n{{{\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission remove bob \'*\'\n}}}\n\nOr one privilege for all users:\n{{{\n  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission remove \'*\' REPORT_ADMIN\n}}}\n\n== Default Permissions\n\nBy default on a new Trac installation, the `anonymous` user will have \'\'view\'\' access to everything in Trac, but will not be able to create or modify anything.\nOn the other hand, the `authenticated` users will have the permissions to \'\'create and modify tickets and wiki pages\'\'.\n\n\'\'\'anonymous\'\'\'\n{{{\n BROWSER_VIEW \n CHANGESET_VIEW \n FILE_VIEW \n LOG_VIEW \n MILESTONE_VIEW \n REPORT_SQL_VIEW \n REPORT_VIEW \n ROADMAP_VIEW \n SEARCH_VIEW \n TICKET_VIEW \n TIMELINE_VIEW\n WIKI_VIEW\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'authenticated\'\'\'\n{{{\n TICKET_CREATE \n TICKET_MODIFY \n WIKI_CREATE \n WIKI_MODIFY  \n}}}\n----\nSee also: TracAdmin, TracGuide and TracFineGrainedPermissions\n',NULL,NULL),('TracPlugins',1,1629200947785549,'trac','127.0.0.1','[[PageOutline(2-5,Contents,pullout)]]\n\n= Trac plugins\n\nTrac is extensible with [trac:PluginList plugins]. Plugin functionality is based on the [trac:TracDev/ComponentArchitecture component architecture], with special cases described in the [trac:TracDev/PluginDevelopment plugin development] page.\n\n== Plugin discovery\n\nFrom the user\'s point of view, a plugin is either a standalone .py file or an .egg package. Trac looks for plugins in Python\'s `site-packages` directory, the [TracIni#GlobalConfiguration global shared] `plugins` directory and the [TracEnvironment project environment] `plugins` directory. Components defined in globally-installed plugins must be explicitly enabled in the [[TracIni#components-section| [components] ]] section of the `trac.ini` file. Components defined in the `plugins` directory of the project environment are enabled, unless explicitly disabled in the `[components]` section of the `trac.ini` file.\n\n== Requirements for Trac eggs #Requirements\n\nTo use egg-based plugins in Trac, you need to have [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools setuptools] (version >= 0.6) installed.\n\nTo install `setuptools`, download the bootstrap module [http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py ez_setup.py] and execute it as follows:\n\n{{{#!sh\n$ python ez_setup.py\n}}}\n\nIf the `ez_setup.py` script fails to install the setuptools release, you can download it from [pypi:setuptools PyPI] and install it manually.\n\nPlugins can also consist of a single `.py` file dropped directly into either the project\'s or the shared `plugins` directory.\n\n== Installing a Trac plugin\n\nThe instructions below are applicable to a plugin packaged as an egg. Plugins implemented as a single `py` file should be downloaded and copied to the [TracEnvironment project environment] `plugins` directory or the [TracIni#GlobalConfiguration global shared] plugins directory.\n\n=== For a single project\n\nIf you have downloaded a source distribution of a plugin, and want to build the `.egg` file:\n\n * Unpack the source. It should provide `setup.py`.\n * Run:\n {{{#!sh\n$ python setup.py bdist_egg\n}}}\n\nYou should now have an *.egg file. Examine the output of running Python to find where this was created.\n\nOnce you have the plugin archive, copy it into the `plugins` directory of the [wiki:TracEnvironment project environment]. Also, make sure that the web server has sufficient permissions to read the plugin egg. Then restart the web server. If you are running as a [wiki:TracStandalone \"tracd\" standalone server], restart tracd, ie kill the process and run again.\n\nTo uninstall a plugin installed this way, remove the egg from the `plugins` directory and restart the web server.\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': the Python version that the egg is built with \'\'must\'\' match the Python version with which Trac is run. For example, if you are running Trac under Python 2.6, but have upgraded your standalone Python to 2.7, the eggs won\'t be recognized.\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': in a multi-project setup, a pool of Python interpreter instances will be dynamically allocated to projects based on need; since plugins occupy a place in Python\'s module system, the first version of any given plugin to be loaded will be used for all projects. In other words, you cannot use different versions of a single plugin in two projects of a multi-project setup. It may be safer to install plugins for all projects (see below), and then enable them selectively on a project-by-project basis.\n\n=== For all projects\n\n==== With an .egg file\n\nSome plugins, such as [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TagsPlugin TracTags], are downloadable as an `.egg` file that can be installed with `easy_install` or `pip`:\n{{{#!sh\n$ easy_install TracTags\n$ pip install TracTags\n}}}\n\nIf `easy_install` is not on your system, see the Requirements section above to install it. Windows users will need to add the `Scripts` directory of their Python installation (for example, `C:\\Python27\\Scripts`) to their `PATH` environment variable, or use the full path to `easy_install` (for example, `C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\easy_install.py`). See [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#windows-notes easy_install Windows notes] for more information.\n\n`pip` is included in Python 2.7.9. In earlier versions of Python it can be installed through the package manager of your OS (e.g. `apt-get install python-pip`) or using the [https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip get_pip.py]. \n\nIf Trac reports permission errors after installing a zipped egg, and you would rather not bother providing an egg cache directory writable by the web server, you can get around it by simply unzipping the egg. Just pass `--always-unzip` to `easy_install`:\n{{{#!sh\n$ easy_install --always-unzip TracTags\n}}}\nYou should end up with a directory having the same name as the zipped egg, complete with `.egg` extension, and containing its uncompressed contents.\n\nTrac also searches for plugins installed in the shared plugins directory, see TracIni#GlobalConfiguration. This is a convenient way to share the installation of plugins across several, but not all, environments.\n\n==== From source\n\n`easy_install` makes installing from source a snap. Just give it the URL to either a Subversion repository or a tarball/zip of the source:\n{{{#!sh\n$ easy_install https://trac-hacks.org/svn/tagsplugin/trunk\n}}}\n\n==== Enabling the plugin\n\nUnlike plugins installed per environment, you\'ll have to explicitly enable globally installed plugins via [wiki:TracIni trac.ini]. This also applies to plugins installed in the shared plugins directory, ie the path specified in the `[inherit] plugins_dir` configuration option. \n\nThis is done in the `[components]` section of the configuration file `trac.ini`. For example:\n{{{#!ini\n[components]\ntractags.* = enabled\n}}}\n\nThe name of the option is the Python package of the plugin. This should be specified in the documentation of the plugin, but can also be easily discovered by looking at the source: look for a top-level directory that contains a file named `__init__.py`.\n\nAfter installing the plugin, you must restart your web server.\n\n==== Upgrading the environment\n\nSome plugins may require an environment upgrade. This will typically be necessary for plugins that implement `IEnvironmentSetupParticipant`. Common reasons for requiring an environment upgrade are to add tables to the database or add configuration parameters to trac.ini. A notification will be displayed when accessing Trac for the first time after installing a plugin and restarting the web server. To upgrade the environment, run the command:\n\n{{{#!sh\n$ trac-admin /path/to/env upgrade\n}}}\n\nA database backup will be made before upgrading the environment, unless the `--no-backup` option is specified. For more information, refer to the documentation output by `trac-admin /path/to/env help upgrade`.\n\n==== Uninstalling\n\nNeither `easy_install` nor `python setup.py` have an uninstall feature. However, it is usually trivial to remove a globally installed egg and reference:\n\n 1. Do `easy_install -m [plugin name]` to remove references from `$PYTHONLIB/site-packages/easy-install.pth` when the plugin installed by setuptools.\n 1. Delete executables from `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, or `C:\\\\Python*\\Scripts`. To find what executables are involved, refer to the `[console-script]` section of `setup.py`.\n 1. Delete the .egg file or folder from where it\'s installed, usually inside `$PYTHONLIB/site-packages/`.\n 1. Restart the web server.\n\nIf you are uncertain about the location of the egg file, you can try to locate it by replacing `myplugin` with whatever namespace the plugin uses (as used when enabling the plugin):\n{{{#!pycon\n>>> import myplugin\n>>> print myplugin.__file__\n/opt/local/python24/lib/site-packages/myplugin-0.4.2-py2.4.egg/myplugin/__init__.pyc\n}}}\n\n== Setting up the plugin cache\n\nSome plugins will need to be extracted by the Python egg\'s runtime (`pkg_resources`), so that their contents are actual files on the file system. The directory in which they are extracted defaults to `.python-eggs` in the home directory of the current user, which may or may not be a problem. You can, however, override the default location using the `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` environment variable.\n\nTo do this from the Apache configuration, use the `SetEnv` directive:\n{{{#!apache\nSetEnv PYTHON_EGG_CACHE /path/to/dir\n}}}\n\nThis works whether you\'re using the [wiki:TracCgi CGI] or the [wiki:TracModPython mod_python] front-end. Put this directive next to where you set the path to the [wiki:TracEnvironment Trac environment], ie in the same `<Location>` block.\n\nFor example for CGI:\n{{{#!apache\n <Location /trac>\n   SetEnv TRAC_ENV /path/to/projenv\n   SetEnv PYTHON_EGG_CACHE /path/to/dir\n </Location>\n}}}\n\nOr for mod_python:\n{{{#!apache\n <Location /trac>\n   SetHandler mod_python\n   ...\n   SetEnv PYTHON_EGG_CACHE /path/to/dir\n </Location>\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': !SetEnv requires the `mod_env` module, which needs to be activated for Apache. In this case the !SetEnv directive can also be used in the `mod_python` Location block.\n\nFor [wiki:TracFastCgi FastCGI], you\'ll need to `-initial-env` option, or whatever is provided by your web server for setting environment variables. \n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': if you already use -initial-env to set the project directory for either a single project or parent, you will need to add an additional -initial-env directive to the !FastCgiConfig directive:\n\n{{{#!apache\nFastCgiConfig -initial-env TRAC_ENV=/var/lib/trac -initial-env PYTHON_EGG_CACHE=/var/lib/trac/plugin-cache\n}}}\n\n=== About hook scripts\n\nIf you have set up some Subversion hook scripts that call the Trac engine, such as the post-commit hook script provided in the `/contrib` directory, make sure you define the `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` environment variable within these scripts as well.\n\n== Web-based plugin administration\n\nThe [trac:WebAdmin] interface offers limited support for plugin configuration through the web to users with `TRAC_ADMIN` permission:\n\n* en/disabling installed plugins\n* installing plugins by uploading them as eggs\n\nIf you wish to disable the second function for security reasons, add the following to your `trac.ini` file:\n{{{#!ini\n[components]\ntrac.admin.web_ui.PluginAdminPanel = disabled\n}}}\nThis disables the whole panel, so the first function will no longer be available either.\n\n== Troubleshooting\n\n=== Is setuptools properly installed?\n\nTry this from the command line:\n{{{#!sh\n$ python -c \"import pkg_resources\"\n}}}\n\nIf you get \'\'\'no output\'\'\', setuptools \'\'\'is\'\'\' installed. Otherwise, you\'ll need to install it before plugins will work in Trac.\n\n=== Did you get the correct version of the Python egg?\n\nPython eggs have the Python version encoded in their filename. For example, `MyPlugin-1.0-py2.5.egg` is an egg for Python 2.5, and will \'\'\'not\'\'\' be loaded if you\'re running a different Python version (such as 2.4 or 2.6).\n\nAlso, verify that the egg file you downloaded is indeed a .zip archive. If you downloaded it from a Trac site, chances are you downloaded the HTML preview page instead.\n\n=== Is the plugin enabled?\n\nIf you install a plugin globally, ie \'\'not\'\' inside the `plugins` directory of the Trac project environment, you must explicitly enable it in [TracIni trac.ini]. Make sure that:\n\n * you actually added the necessary line(s) to the `[components]` section.\n * the package/module names are correct and do not contain typos.\n * the value is \"enabled\", not \"enable\" or \"Enable\".\n * the section name is \"components\", not \"component\".\n\n=== Check the permissions on the .egg file\n\nTrac must be able to read the .egg file. \n\n=== Check the log files\n\nEnable [wiki:TracLogging logging] and set the log level to `DEBUG`, then watch the log file for messages about loading plugins.\n\n=== Verify you have the proper permissions\n\nSome plugins require you have special permissions in order to use them. [trac:WebAdmin WebAdmin], for example, requires the user to have `TRAC_ADMIN` permissions for it to show up on the navigation bar.\n\n=== Is the wrong version of the plugin loading?\n\nIf you put your plugins inside plugins directories, and certainly if you have more than one project, you need to make sure that the correct version of the plugin is loading. Here are some basic rules:\n\n * Only one version of the plugin can be loaded for each running Trac server, ie each Python process. The Python namespaces and module list will be shared, and it cannot handle duplicates. Whether a plugin is `enabled` or `disabled` makes no difference.\n * A globally installed plugin (typically `setup.py install`) will override any version in the global or project plugins directories. A plugin from the global plugins directory will be located \'\'before\'\' any project plugins directory.\n * If your Trac server hosts more than one project (as with `TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR` setups), having two versions of a plugin in two different projects will give unpredicatable results. Only one of them will load, and the one loaded will be shared by both projects. Trac will load the first plugin found, usually from the project that receives the first request.\n * Having more than one version listed inside Python site-packages is fine, ie installed with `setup.py install`, because setuptools will make sure you get the version installed most recently. However, don\'t store more than one version inside a global or project plugins directory: neither the version number nor the installed date will matter at all. There is no way to determine which one will be located first when Trac searches the directory for plugins.\n\n=== If all of the above failed\n\nOkay, so the logs don\'t mention plugins, the egg is readable, the Python version is correct, \'\'and\'\' the egg has been installed globally (and is enabled in trac.ini)... and it \'\'still\'\' doesn\'t work or give any error messages or any other indication as to why. Hop on the [trac:IrcChannel IrcChannel] and ask away!\n\n----\nSee also TracGuide, [trac:PluginList plugin list], [trac:TracDev/ComponentArchitecture component architecture].',NULL,NULL),('TracQuery',1,1629200947550733,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac Ticket Queries\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nIn addition to [wiki:TracReports reports], Trac provides support for \'\'custom ticket queries\'\', which can be used to display tickets that meet specified criteria. \n\nTo configure and execute a custom query, switch to the \'\'View Tickets\'\' module from the navigation bar, and select the \'\'Custom Query\'\' link.\n\n== Filters\n\nWhen you first go to the query page, the default filter will display tickets relevant to you:\n * If logged in then all open tickets, it will display open tickets assigned to you.\n * If not logged in but you have specified a name or email address in the preferences, then it will display all open tickets where your email (or name if email not defined) is in the CC list.\n * If not logged in and no name/email is defined in the preferences, then all open issues are displayed.\n\nCurrent filters can be removed by clicking the button to the left with the minus sign on the label. New filters are added from the dropdown lists at the bottom corners of the filters box; \'And\' conditions on the left, \'Or\' conditions on the right.  Filters with either a text box or a dropdown menu of options can be added multiple times to perform an \'\'Or\'\' on the criteria.\n\nYou can use the fields just below the filters box to group the results based on a field, or display the full description for each ticket.\n\nAfter you have edited your filters, click the \'\'Update\'\' button to refresh your results.\n\n== Navigating Tickets\n\nClicking on one of the query results will take you to that ticket. You can navigate through the results by clicking the \'\'Next Ticket\'\' or \'\'Previous Ticket\'\' links just below the main menu bar, or click the \'\'Back to Query\'\' link to return to the query page.  \n\nYou can safely edit any of the tickets and continue to navigate through the results using the \'\'!Next/Previous/Back to Query\'\' links after saving your results. When you return to the query \'\'any tickets which were edited\'\' will be displayed with italicized text. If one of the tickets was edited such that [[html(<span style=\"color: grey\">it no longer matches the query criteria </span>)]], the text will also be greyed. Lastly, if \'\'\'a new ticket matching the query criteria has been created\'\'\', it will be shown in bold. \n\nThe query results can be refreshed and cleared of these status indicators by clicking the \'\'Update\'\' button again.\n\n== Saving Queries\n\nTrac allows you to save the query as a named query accessible from the reports module. To save a query ensure that you have \'\'Updated\'\' the view and then click the \'\'Save query\'\' button displayed beneath the results.\nYou can also save references to queries in Wiki content, as described below.\n\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' one way to easily build queries like the ones below, you can build and test the queries in the Custom report module and when ready - click \'\'Save query\'\'. This will build the query string for you. All you need to do is remove the extra line breaks.\n\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' you must have the \'\'\'REPORT_CREATE\'\'\' permission in order to save queries to the list of default reports. The \'\'Save query\'\' button will only appear if you are logged in as a user that has been granted this permission. If your account does not have permission to create reports, you can still use the methods below to save a query.\n\n=== Using TracLinks\n\nYou may want to save some queries so that you can come back to them later. You can do this by making a link to the query from any Wiki page.\n{{{\n[query:status=new|assigned|reopened&version=1.0 Active tickets against 1.0]\n}}}\n\nWhich is displayed as:\n  [query:status=new|assigned|reopened&version=1.0 Active tickets against 1.0]\n\nThis uses a very simple query language to specify the criteria, see [wiki:TracQuery#QueryLanguage Query Language].\n\nAlternatively, you can copy the query string of a query and paste that into the Wiki link, including the leading `?` character:\n{{{\n[query:?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&group=owner Assigned tickets by owner]\n}}}\n\nWhich is displayed as:\n  [query:?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&group=owner Assigned tickets by owner]\n\n=== Customizing the \'\'table\'\' format\n\nYou can also customize the columns displayed in the table format (\'\'format=table\'\') by using \'\'col=<field>\'\'. You can specify multiple fields and what order they are displayed in by placing pipes (`|`) between the columns:\n{{{\n[[TicketQuery(max=3,status=closed,order=id,desc=1,format=table,col=resolution|summary|owner|reporter)]]\n}}}\n\nThis is displayed as:\n[[TicketQuery(max=3,status=closed,order=id,desc=1,format=table,col=resolution|summary|owner|reporter)]]\n\n==== Full rows\n\nIn \'\'table\'\' format you can also have full rows by using \'\'rows=<field>\'\':\n{{{\n[[TicketQuery(max=3,status=closed,order=id,desc=1,format=table,col=resolution|summary|owner|reporter,rows=description)]]\n}}}\n\nThis is displayed as:\n[[TicketQuery(max=3,status=closed,order=id,desc=1,format=table,col=resolution|summary|owner|reporter,rows=description)]]\n\n== Query Language\n\n`query:` TracLinks and the `[[TicketQuery]]` macro both use a mini “query language” for specifying query filters. Filters are separated by ampersands (`&`). Each filter consists of the ticket field name, an operator and one or more values. More than one value are separated by a pipe (`|`), meaning that the filter matches any of the values. To include a literal `&` or `|` in a value, escape the character with a backslash (`\\`).\n\nThe available operators are:\n|| \'\'\'`=`\'\'\' || the field content exactly matches one of the values ||\n|| \'\'\'`~=`\'\'\' || the field content contains one or more of the values ||\n|| \'\'\'`^=`\'\'\' || the field content starts with one of the values ||\n|| \'\'\'`$=`\'\'\' || the field content ends with one of the values ||\n\nAll of these operators can also be negated:\n|| \'\'\'`!=`\'\'\' || the field content matches none of the values ||\n|| \'\'\'`!~=`\'\'\' || the field content does not contain any of the values ||\n|| \'\'\'`!^=`\'\'\' || the field content does not start with any of the values ||\n|| \'\'\'`!$=`\'\'\' || the field content does not end with any of the values ||\n\nThe date fields `created` and `modified` can be constrained by using the `=` operator and specifying a value containing two dates separated by two dots (`..`). Either end of the date range can be left empty, meaning that the corresponding end of the range is open. The date parser understands a few natural date specifications like \"3 weeks ago\", \"last month\" and \"now\", as well as Bugzilla-style date specifications like \"1d\", \"2w\", \"3m\" or \"4y\" for 1 day, 2 weeks, 3 months and 4 years, respectively. Spaces in date specifications can be omitted to avoid having to quote the query string. \n|| \'\'\'`created=2007-01-01..2008-01-01`\'\'\' || query tickets created in 2007 ||\n|| \'\'\'`created=lastmonth..thismonth`\'\'\' || query tickets created during the previous month ||\n|| \'\'\'`modified=1weekago..`\'\'\' || query tickets that have been modified in the last week ||\n|| \'\'\'`modified=..30daysago`\'\'\' || query tickets that have been inactive for the last 30 days ||\n\n----\nSee also: TracTickets, TracReports, TracGuide, TicketQuery\n',NULL,NULL),('TracReports',1,1629200947705104,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Trac Reports\n\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nThe Trac reports module provides a simple, yet powerful reporting facility to present information about tickets in the Trac database.\n\nRather than have its own report definition format, TracReports relies on standard SQL `SELECT` statements for custom report definition. \n\n  \'\'\'Note:\'\'\' The report module is being phased out in its current form because it seriously limits the ability of the Trac team to make adjustments to the underlying database schema. We believe that the [wiki:TracQuery query module] is a good replacement that provides more flexibility and better usability. While there are certain reports that cannot yet be handled by the query module, we intend to further enhance it so that at some point the reports module can be completely removed. This also means that there will be no major enhancements to the report module anymore.\n\n  You can already completely replace the reports module by the query module simply by disabling the former in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini]:\n  {{{#!ini\n  [components]\n  trac.ticket.report.* = disabled\n  }}}\n  This will make the query module the default handler for the “View Tickets” navigation item. We encourage you to try this configuration and report back what kind of features of reports you are missing, if any.\n\nA report consists of these basic parts:\n * \'\'\'ID\'\'\' — Unique (sequential) identifier \n * \'\'\'Title\'\'\' — Descriptive title\n * \'\'\'Description\'\'\' — A brief description of the report, in WikiFormatting text.\n * \'\'\'Report Body\'\'\' — List of results from report query, formatted according to the methods described below.\n * \'\'\'Footer\'\'\' — Links to alternative download formats for this report.\n\n== Changing Sort Order\n\nSimple reports - ungrouped reports to be specific - can be changed to be sorted by any column simply by clicking the column header. \n\nIf a column header is a hyperlink (red), click the column you would like to sort by. Clicking the same header again reverses the order.\n\n== Changing Report Numbering\n\nThere may be instances where you need to change the ID of the report, perhaps to organize the reports better. At present this requires changes to the trac database. The \'\'report\'\' table has the following schema:\n * id integer PRIMARY KEY\n * author text\n * title text\n * query text\n * description text\nChanging the ID changes the shown order and number in the \'\'Available Reports\'\' list and the report\'s perma-link. This is done by running something like:\n{{{#!sql\nUPDATE report SET id = 5 WHERE id = 3;\n}}}\nKeep in mind that the integrity has to be maintained, ie ID has to be unique, and you don\'t want to exceed the max, since that\'s managed by SQLite someplace.\n\nYou may also need to update or remove the report number stored in the report or query.\n\n== Navigating Tickets\n\nClicking on one of the report results will take you to that ticket. You can navigate through the results by clicking the \'\'Next Ticket\'\' or \'\'Previous Ticket\'\' links just below the main menu bar, or click the \'\'Back to Report\'\' link to return to the report page.\n\nYou can safely edit any of the tickets and continue to navigate through the results using the \'\'!Next/Previous/Back to Report\'\' links after saving your results, but when you return to the report, there will be no hint about what has changed, as would happen if you were navigating a list of tickets obtained from a query (see TracQuery#NavigatingTickets).\n\n== Alternative Download Formats\n\nAside from the default HTML view, reports can also be exported in a number of alternative formats.\nAt the bottom of the report page, you will find a list of available data formats. Click the desired link to \ndownload the alternative report format.\n\n=== Comma-delimited - CSV (Comma Separated Values)\n\nExport the report as plain text, each row on its own line, columns separated by a single comma (\',\').\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' The output is fully escaped so carriage returns, line feeds, and commas will be preserved in the output.\n\n=== Tab-delimited\n\nLike above, but uses tabs (\\t) instead of comma.\n\n=== RSS - XML Content Syndication\n\nAll reports support syndication using XML/RSS 2.0. To subscribe to an RSS feed, click the orange \'XML\' icon at the bottom of the page. See TracRss for general information on RSS support in Trac.\n\n== Creating Custom Reports\n\nCreating a custom report requires a comfortable knowledge of SQL.\n\nNote that you need to set up [TracPermissions#Reports permissions] in order to see the buttons for adding or editing reports.\n\nA report is basically a single named SQL query, executed and presented by Trac. Reports can be viewed and created from a custom SQL expression directly in the web interface.\n\nTypically, a report consists of a SELECT-expression from the \'ticket\' table, using the available columns and sorting the way you want it.\n\n== Ticket columns\n\nThe \'\'ticket\'\' table has the following columns:\n * id\n * type\n * time\n * changetime\n * component\n * severity  \n * priority \n * owner\n * reporter\n * cc\n * version\n * milestone\n * status\n * resolution\n * summary\n * description\n * keywords\n\nSee TracTickets for a detailed description of the column fields.\n\nExample: \'\'\'All active tickets, sorted by priority and time\'\'\'\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT id AS ticket, status, severity, priority, owner, time AS created, summary \nFROM ticket \nWHERE status IN (\'new\', \'assigned\', \'reopened\')\nORDER BY priority, time\n}}}\n\n== Advanced Reports: Dynamic Variables\n\nFor more flexible reports, Trac supports the use of \'\'dynamic variables\'\' in report SQL statements. \nIn short, dynamic variables are \'\'special\'\' strings that are replaced by custom data before query execution.\n\n=== Using Variables in a Query\n\nThe syntax for dynamic variables is simple, any upper case word beginning with \'$\' is considered a variable.\n\nExample:\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT id AS ticket,summary FROM ticket WHERE priority=$PRIORITY\n}}}\n\nTo assign a value to $PRIORITY when viewing the report, you must define it as an argument in the report URL, leaving out the leading \'$\':\n{{{\n http://trac.edgewall.org/reports/14?PRIORITY=high\n}}}\n\nTo use multiple variables, separate them with an \'&\':\n{{{\n http://trac.edgewall.org/reports/14?PRIORITY=high&SEVERITY=critical\n}}}\n\n=== !Special/Constant Variables\n\nThere is one dynamic variable whose value is set automatically (the URL does not have to be changed) to allow practical reports. \n\n * $USER — Username of logged in user.\n\nExample: List all tickets assigned to me:\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT id AS ticket,summary FROM ticket WHERE owner=$USER\n}}}\n\n== Advanced Reports: Custom Formatting\n\nTrac is also capable of more advanced reports, including custom layouts, result grouping and user-defined CSS styles. To create such reports, we will use specialized SQL statements to control the output of the Trac report engine.\n\n=== Special Columns\n\nTo format reports, TracReports looks for \'magic\' column names in the query result. These \'magic\' names are processed and affect the layout and style of the final report.\n\n=== Automatically formatted columns\n\n * \'\'\'ticket\'\'\' — Ticket ID number. Becomes a hyperlink to that ticket. \n * \'\'\'id\'\'\' — same as \'\'\'ticket\'\'\' above when \'\'\'realm\'\'\' is not set\n * \'\'\'realm\'\'\' — together with \'\'\'id\'\'\', can be used to create links to other resources than tickets (e.g. a realm of \'\'wiki\'\' and an \'\'id\'\' to a page name will create a link to that wiki page)\n   - for some kind of resources, it may be necessary to specify their \'\'parent\'\' resources (e.g. for \'\'changeset\'\', which \'\'repos\'\') and this can be achieved using the \'\'\'parent_realm\'\'\' and \'\'\'parent_id\'\'\' columns\n * \'\'\'created, modified, date, time\'\'\' — Format cell as a date and/or time.\n * \'\'\'description\'\'\' — Ticket description field, parsed through the wiki engine.\n\n\'\'\'Example:\'\'\'\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT id AS ticket, created, status, summary FROM ticket \n}}}\n\nThose columns can also be defined but marked as hidden, see [#column-syntax below].\n\nSee trac:wiki/CookBook/Configuration/Reports for some example of creating reports for realms other than \'\'ticket\'\'.\n\n=== Custom formatting columns\n\nColumns whose names begin and end with 2 underscores (Example: \'\'\'`__color__`\'\'\') are\nassumed to be \'\'formatting hints\'\', affecting the appearance of the row.\n \n * \'\'\'`__group__`\'\'\' — Group results based on values in this column. Each group will have its own header and table.\n * \'\'\'`__grouplink__`\'\'\' — Make the header of each group a link to the specified URL. The URL is taken from the first row of each group.\n * \'\'\'`__color__`\'\'\' — Should be a numeric value ranging from 1 to 5 to select a pre-defined row color. Typically used to color rows by issue priority.\n{{{\n#!html\n<div style=\"margin-left:7.5em\">Defaults: \n<span style=\"border: none; color: #333; background: transparent;  font-size: 85%; background: #fdc; border-color: #e88; color: #a22\">Color 1</span>\n<span style=\"border: none; color: #333; background: transparent;  font-size: 85%; background: #ffb; border-color: #eea; color: #880\">Color 2</span>\n<span style=\"border: none; color: #333; background: transparent;  font-size: 85%; background: #fbfbfb; border-color: #ddd; color: #444\">Color 3</span>\n<span style=\"border: none; color: #333; background: transparent; font-size: 85%; background: #e7ffff; border-color: #cee; color: #099\">Color 4</span>\n<span style=\"border: none; color: #333; background: transparent;  font-size: 85%; background: #e7eeff; border-color: #cde; color: #469\">Color 5</span>\n</div>\n}}}\n * \'\'\'`__style__`\'\'\' — A custom CSS style expression to use on the `<tr>` element of the current row.\n * \'\'\'`__class__`\'\'\' — Zero or more space-separated CSS class names to be set on the `<tr>` element of the current row. These classes are added to the class name derived from `__color__` and the odd / even indicator.\n\n\'\'\'Example:\'\'\' \'\'List active tickets, grouped by milestone, group header linked to milestone page, colored by priority\'\'\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT p.value AS __color__,\n     t.milestone AS __group__,\n     \'../milestone/\' || t.milestone AS __grouplink__,\n     (CASE owner WHEN \'daniel\' THEN \'font-weight: bold; background: red;\' ELSE \'\' END) AS __style__,\n     t.id AS ticket, summary\nFROM ticket t,enum p\nWHERE t.status IN (\'new\', \'assigned\', \'reopened\') \n  AND p.name = t.priority AND p.type = \'priority\'\nORDER BY t.milestone, p.value, t.severity, t.time\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' A table join is used to match \'\'ticket\'\' priorities with their numeric representation from the \'\'enum\'\' table.\n\n=== Changing layout of report rows === #column-syntax\n\nBy default, all columns on each row are display on a single row in the HTML report, possibly formatted according to the descriptions above. However, it is also possible to create multi-line report entries.\n\n * \'\'\'`column_`\'\'\' — \'\'Break row after this\'\'. By appending an underscore (\'_\') to the column name, the remaining columns will be continued on a second line.\n\n * \'\'\'`_column_`\'\'\' — \'\'Full row\'\'. By adding an underscore (\'_\') both at the beginning and the end of a column name, the data will be shown on a separate row.\n\n * \'\'\'`_column`\'\'\' — \'\'Hide data\'\'. Prepending an underscore (\'_\') to a column name instructs Trac to hide the contents from the HTML output. This is useful for information to be visible only if downloaded in other formats (like CSV or RSS/XML).\n   This can be used to hide any kind of column, even important ones required for identifying the resource, e.g. `id as _id` will hide the \'\'\'Id\'\'\' column but the link to the ticket will be present.\n\n\'\'\'Example:\'\'\' \'\'List active tickets, grouped by milestone, colored by priority, with  description and multi-line layout\'\'\n\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT p.value AS __color__,\n       t.milestone AS __group__,\n       (CASE owner \n          WHEN \'daniel\' THEN \'font-weight: bold; background: red;\' \n          ELSE \'\' END) AS __style__,\n       t.id AS ticket, summary AS summary_,             -- ## Break line here\n       component,version, severity, milestone, status, owner,\n       time AS created, changetime AS modified,         -- ## Dates are formatted\n       description AS _description_,                    -- ## Uses a full row\n       changetime AS _changetime, reporter AS _reporter -- ## Hidden from HTML output\nFROM ticket t,enum p\nWHERE t.status IN (\'new\', \'assigned\', \'reopened\') \n  AND p.name = t.priority AND p.type = \'priority\'\nORDER BY t.milestone, p.value, t.severity, t.time\n}}}\n\n=== Reporting on custom fields\n\nIf you have added custom fields to your tickets (see TracTicketsCustomFields), you can write a SQL query to cover them. You\'ll need to make a join on the ticket_custom table, but this isn\'t especially easy.\n\nIf you have tickets in the database \'\'before\'\' you declare the extra fields in trac.ini, there will be no associated data in the ticket_custom table. To get around this, use SQL\'s \"LEFT OUTER JOIN\" clauses. See [trac:TracIniReportCustomFieldSample TracIniReportCustomFieldSample] for some examples.\n\n=== A note about SQL rewriting #rewriting\n\nBeyond the relatively trivial replacement of dynamic variables, the SQL query is also altered in order to support two features of the reports:\n 1. [#sort-order changing the sort order]\n 1. pagination support (limitation of the number of result rows displayed on each page)\nIn order to support the first feature, the sort column is inserted in the `ORDER BY` clause in the first position or in the second position if a `__group__` column is specified (an `ORDER BY` clause is created if needed). In order to support pagination, a `LIMIT ... OFFSET ...` clause is appended.\nThe query might be too complex for the automatic rewrite to work correctly, resulting in an erroneous query. In this case you still have the possibility to control exactly how the rewrite is done by manually inserting the following tokens:\n - `@SORT_COLUMN@`, the place where the name of the selected sort column will be inserted,\n - `@LIMIT_OFFSET@`, the place where the pagination support clause will be added\nNote that if you write them after an SQL comment, `--`, you\'ll effectively disable rewriting if this is what you want!\n\nLet\'s take an example, consider the following SQL query:\n{{{#!sql\n-- ## 4: Assigned, Active Tickets by Owner ## --\n\n-- \n-- List assigned tickets, group by ticket owner, sorted by priority.\n-- \n\nSELECT p.value AS __color__,\n   owner AS __group__,\n   id AS ticket, summary, component, milestone, t.type AS type, severity, time AS created,\n   changetime AS _changetime, description AS _description,\n   reporter AS _reporter\nFROM ticket t,enum p\nWHERE status = \'assigned\'\n  AND p.name = t.priority AND p.type = \'priority\'\nORDER BY __group__, p.value, severity, time\n}}}\n\nThe automatic rewrite will be the following (4 rows per page, page 2, sorted by `component`):\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT p.value AS __color__,\n   owner AS __group__,\n   id AS ticket, summary, component, milestone, t.type AS type, severity, time AS created,\n   changetime AS _changetime, description AS _description,\n   reporter AS _reporter\nFROM ticket t,enum p\nWHERE status = \'assigned\'\n  AND p.name = t.priority AND p.type = \'priority\'\nORDER BY __group__ ASC, `component` ASC,  __group__, p.value, severity, time\nLIMIT 4 OFFSET 4\n}}}\n\nThe equivalent SQL query with the rewrite tokens would have been:\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT p.value AS __color__,\n   owner AS __group__,\n   id AS ticket, summary, component, milestone, t.type AS type, severity, time AS created,\n   changetime AS _changetime, description AS _description,\n   reporter AS _reporter\nFROM ticket t,enum p\nWHERE status = \'assigned\'\n  AND p.name = t.priority AND p.type = \'priority\'\nORDER BY __group__, @SORT_COLUMN@, p.value, severity, time\n@LIMIT_OFFSET@\n}}}\n\nIf you want to always sort first by priority and only then by the user selected sort column, simply use the following `ORDER BY` clause:\n{{{#!sql\nORDER BY __group__, p.value, @SORT_COLUMN@, severity, time\n}}}\n\n----\nSee also: TracTickets, TracQuery, TracGuide, [http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html Query Language Understood by SQLite]\n',NULL,NULL),('TracRepositoryAdmin',1,1629200947713088,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Repository Administration\n[[PageOutline(2-3)]]\n\n== Quick start #QuickStart\n\n * Manage repositories in the \"Repository\" admin panel, with `trac-admin` or in the `[repositories]` section of [wiki:TracIni#repositories-section trac.ini].\n * Set up a call to `trac-admin $ENV changeset added $REPO $REV` in the post-commit hook of each repository. Additionally, add a call to `trac-admin $ENV changeset modified $REPO $REV` in the post-revprop-change hook of repositories allowing revision property changes.\n * Set the `[trac] repository_sync_per_request` option to an empty value to disable per-request syncing.\n * Make sure the user under which your Subversion hooks are run has write access to the Trac environment, or use a tool like `sudo` to temporarily elevate privileges.\n\n== Specifying repositories #Repositories\nStarting with 0.12, Trac can handle more than one repository per environment. The pre-0.12 way of specifying the repository with the `repository_dir` and `repository_type` options in the `[trac]` section of [wiki:TracIni trac.ini] is still supported, but two new mechanisms allow including additional repositories into an environment.\n\nIt is also possible to define aliases of repositories, that act as \"pointers\" to real repositories. This can be useful when renaming a repository, to avoid breaking all the links to the old name.\n\nA number of attributes can be associated with each repository, which define the repository\'s location, type, name and how it is displayed in the source browser. The following attributes are supported:\n\n||=\'\'\'Attribute\'\'\' =||=\'\'\'Description\'\'\' =||\n||`alias` ||\\\n||A repository having an `alias` attribute is an alias to a real repository. All TracLinks referencing the alias resolve to the aliased repository. Note that multiple indirection is not supported, so an alias must always point to a real repository. The `alias` and `dir` attributes are mutually exclusive. ||\n||`description` ||\\\n||The text specified in the `description` attribute is displayed below the top-level entry for the repository in the source browser. It supports WikiFormatting. ||\n||`dir` ||\\\n||The `dir` attribute specifies the location of the repository in the filesystem. It corresponds to the value previously specified in the option `[trac] repository_dir`. The `alias` and `dir` attributes are mutually exclusive. ||\n||`hidden` ||When set to `true`, the repository is hidden from the repository index page in the source browser. Browsing the repository is still possible, and links referencing the repository remain valid. ||\n||`type` ||The `type` attribute sets the type of version control system used by the repository. Trac supports Subversion and Git out-of-the-box, and plugins add support for many other systems. If `type` is not specified, it defaults to the value of the `[trac] repository_type` option. ||\n||`url` ||The `url` attribute specifies the root URL to be used for checking out from the repository. When specified, a \"Repository URL\" link is added to the context navigation links in the source browser, that can be copied into the tool used for creating the working copy. ||\n\nA repository `name` and one of `alias` or `dir` attributes are mandatory. All others are optional.\n\nAfter adding a repository, the cache for that repository must be re-synchronized once with the `trac-admin $ENV repository resync` command.\n\n `repository resync <repos>`::\n   Re-synchronize Trac with a repository.\n\n\n=== In `trac.ini` #ReposTracIni\nRepositories and repository attributes can be specified in the `[repositories]` section of [wiki:TracIni#repositories-section trac.ini]. Every attribute consists of a key structured as `{name}.{attribute}` and the corresponding value separated with an equal sign (`=`). The name of the default repository is empty.\n\nThe main advantage of specifying repositories in `trac.ini` is that they can be inherited from a global configuration (see the [wiki:TracIni#GlobalConfiguration global configuration] section of TracIni). One drawback is that, due to limitations in the `ConfigParser` class used to parse `trac.ini`, the repository name is always all-lowercase.\n\nThe following example defines two Subversion repositories named `project` and `lib`, and an alias to `project` as the default repository. This is a typical use case where a Trac environment previously had a single repository (the `project` repository), and was converted to multiple repositories. The alias ensures that links predating the change continue to resolve to the `project` repository.\n{{{#!ini\n[repositories]\nproject.dir = /var/repos/project\nproject.description = This is the \'\'main\'\' project repository.\nproject.type = svn\nproject.url = http://example.com/svn/project\nproject.hidden = true\n\nlib.dir = /var/repos/lib\nlib.description = This is the secondary library code.\nlib.type = svn\nlib.url = http://example.com/svn/lib\n\n.alias = project\n}}}\nNote that `name.alias = target` makes `name` an alias for the `target` repo, not the other way around.\n\n=== In the database #ReposDatabase\nRepositories can also be specified in the database, using either the \"Repositories\" admin panel under \"Version Control\", or the `trac-admin $ENV repository` commands.\n\nThe admin panel shows the list of all repositories defined in the Trac environment. It allows adding repositories and aliases, editing repository attributes and removing repositories. Note that repositories defined in `trac.ini` are displayed but cannot be edited.\n\nThe following [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] commands can be used to perform repository operations from the command line.\n\n `repository add <repos> <dir> [type]`::\n   Add a repository `<repos>` located at `<dir>`, and optionally specify its type.\n\n `repository alias <name> <target>`::\n   Create an alias `<name>` for the repository `<target>`.\n\n `repository remove <repos>`::\n   Remove the repository `<repos>`.\n\n `repository set <repos> <key> <value>`::\n   Set the attribute `<key>` to `<value>` for the repository `<repos>`. \n\nNote that the default repository has an empty name, so it will likely need to be quoted when running `trac-admin` from a shell. Alternatively, the name \"`(default)`\" can be used instead, for example when running `trac-admin` in interactive mode.\n\n== Repository caching\n\nThe Subversion and Git repository connectors support caching, which improves the performance browsing the repository, viewing logs and viewing changesets. Cached repositories must be [#Synchronization synchronized]; either explicit or implicit synchronization can be used. When searching changesets, only cached repositories are searched.\n\nSubversion repositories are cached unless the type is `direct-svnfs`. Git repositories are cached when `[git]` [wiki:TracIni#git-section cached_repository] is `true`.\n\n== Repository synchronization #Synchronization\nPrior to 0.12, Trac synchronized its cache with the repository on every HTTP request. This approach is not very efficient and not practical anymore with multiple repositories. For this reason, explicit synchronization through post-commit hooks was added. \n\nThere is also new functionality in the form of a repository listener extension point \'\'(IRepositoryChangeListener)\'\' that is triggered by the post-commit hook when a changeset is added or modified, and can be used by plugins to perform actions on commit.\n\n=== Mercurial Repositories\nPlease note that at the time of writing, no initial resynchronization or any hooks are necessary for Mercurial repositories - see [trac:#9485] for more information. \n\n=== Explicit synchronization #ExplicitSync\nThis is the preferred method of repository synchronization. It requires setting the `[trac]  repository_sync_per_request` option in [wiki:TracIni#trac-section trac.ini] to an empty value, and adding a call to `trac-admin` in the `post-commit` hook of each repository. Additionally, if a repository allows changing revision metadata, a call to `trac-admin` must be added to the `post-revprop-change` hook as well.\n\n `changeset added <repos> <rev> [...]`::\n   Notify Trac that one or more changesets have been added to a repository.\n\n `changeset modified <repos> <rev> [...]`::\n   Notify Trac that metadata on one or more changesets in a repository has been modified.\n\nThe `<repos>` argument can be either a repository name (use \"`(default)`\" for the default repository) or the path to the repository.\n\nNote that you may have to set the environment variable `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` to the same value as was used for the web server configuration before calling `trac-admin`, if you changed it from its default location. See [wiki:TracPlugins Trac Plugins] for more information.\n\n==== Subversion\n\nThe following examples are complete post-commit and post-revprop-change scripts for Subversion. They should be edited for the specific environment, marked executable (where applicable) and placed in the `hooks` directory of each repository. On Unix (`post-commit`):\n{{{#!sh\n#!/bin/sh\nexport PYTHON_EGG_CACHE=\"/path/to/dir\"\n/usr/bin/trac-admin /path/to/env changeset added \"$1\" \"$2\"\n}}}\nNote: Check with `whereis trac-admin`, whether `trac-admin` is really installed under `/usr/bin/` or maybe under `/usr/local/bin/` and adapt the path.\nOn Windows (`post-commit.cmd`):\n{{{#!bat\n@C:\\Python26\\Scripts\\trac-admin.exe C:\\path\\to\\env changeset added \"%1\" \"%2\"\n}}}\n\nThe post-revprop-change hook for Subversion is very similar. On Unix (`post-revprop-change`):\n{{{#!sh\n#!/bin/sh\nexport PYTHON_EGG_CACHE=\"/path/to/dir\"\n/usr/bin/trac-admin /path/to/env changeset modified \"$1\" \"$2\"\n}}}\nOn Windows (`post-revprop-change.cmd`):\n{{{#!bat\n@C:\\Python26\\Scripts\\trac-admin.exe C:\\path\\to\\env changeset modified \"%1\" \"%2\"\n}}}\n\nThe Unix variants above assume that the user running the Subversion commit has write access to the Trac environment, which is the case in the standard configuration where both the repository and Trac are served by the web server. If you access the repository through another means, for example `svn+ssh://`, you may have to run `trac-admin` with different privileges, for example by using `sudo`.\n\nNote that calling `trac-admin` in your Subversion hooks can slow down the commit and log editing operations on the client side. You might want to use the [trac:source:trunk/contrib/trac-svn-hook contrib/trac-svn-hook] script which starts `trac-admin` in an asynchronous way. The script also comes with a number of safety checks and usage advices which should make it easier to set up and test your hooks. There\'s no equivalent `trac-svn-hook.bat` for Windows yet, but the script can be run by Cygwin\'s bash.\n\nSee the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.reposadmin.create.html#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks section about hooks] in the Subversion book for more information. Other repository types will require different hook setups.\n\n==== Git\n\nGit hooks can be used in the same way for explicit syncing of Git repositories.  If your git repository is one that gets committed to directly on the machine that hosts trac, add the following to the `hooks/post-commit` file in your git repo (note: this will do nothing if you only update the repo by pushing to it):\n{{{#!sh\n#!/bin/sh \nREV=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \ntrac-admin /path/to/env changeset added <repos> $REV \n}}}\n\nAlternately, if your repository is one that only gets pushed to, add the following to the `hooks/post-receive` file in the repo:\n{{{#!sh\n#!/bin/sh\ntracenv=/path/to/env     # change with your Trac environment\'s path\nrepos=                   # change with your repository\'s name\nwhile read oldrev newrev refname; do\n    if [ \"$oldrev\" = 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ]; then\n        git rev-list --reverse \"$newrev\" --\n    else\n        git rev-list --reverse \"$newrev\" \"^$oldrev\" --\n    fi | xargs trac-admin \"$tracenv\" changeset added \"$repos\"\ndone\n}}}\n\nThe `<repos>` argument can be either a repository name (use \"`(default)`\" for the default repository) or the path to the repository.\n\n==== Mercurial\n\nFor Mercurial, add the following entries to the `.hgrc` file of each repository accessed by Trac (if [trac:TracMercurial] is installed in a Trac `plugins` directory, download [trac:source:mercurial-plugin/tracext/hg/hooks.py hooks.py] and place it somewhere accessible):\n{{{#!ini\n[hooks]\n; If mercurial-plugin is installed globally\ncommit = python:tracext.hg.hooks.add_changesets\nchangegroup = python:tracext.hg.hooks.add_changesets\n\n; If mercurial-plugin is installed in a Trac plugins directory\ncommit = python:/path/to/hooks.py:add_changesets\nchangegroup = python:/path/to/hooks.py:add_changesets\n\n[trac]\nenv = /path/to/env\ntrac-admin = /path/to/trac-admin\n}}}\n\n=== Per-request synchronization #PerRequestSync\nIf the post-commit hooks are not available, the environment can be set up for per-request synchronization. In that case, the `[trac] repository_sync_per_request` option in [wiki:TracIni#trac-section trac.ini] must be set to a comma-separated list of repository names to be synchronized.\n\nNote that in this case, the changeset listener extension point is not called, and therefore plugins using it will not work correctly.\n\n\n== Automatic changeset references in tickets\n\nYou can automatically add a reference to the changeset as a ticket comment whenever changes are committed to the repository. The description of the commit needs to contain one of the following formulas:\n * \'\'\'`Refs #123`\'\'\' - to reference this changeset in `#123` ticket\n * \'\'\'`Fixes #123`\'\'\' - to reference this changeset and close `#123` ticket with the default status \'\'fixed\'\'\n\nThis functionality requires installing a post-commit hook as described in [#ExplicitSync], and enabling the optional commit updater components by adding the following line to the `[components]` section of your [wiki:TracIni#components-section trac.ini], or enabling the components in the //Plugins// admin panel.\n{{{#!ini\ntracopt.ticket.commit_updater.* = enabled\n}}}\nFor more information, see the documentation of the `CommitTicketUpdater` component in the //Plugins// admin panel and the [trac:CommitTicketUpdater] page.\n\n== Migration from a single-repository setup (Subversion) #Migration\nThe following procedure illustrates a typical migration from a Subversion single-repository setup to multiple repositories.\n\n 1. Remove the default repository specification from the `[trac] repository_dir` option.\n 1. Add the main repository as a named repository.\n 1. Re-synchronize the main repository.\n 1. Set up post-commit and post-revprop-change hooks on the \"main\" repository, and set `[trac] repository_sync_per_request` to an empty value.\n 1. Add an alias to the main repository as the default repository (by leaving out the the `name`, e.g. `.alias = main`). This ensures that all links predating the migration still resolve to the main repository.\n 1. Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 to add other \"named\" repositories as needed.\n\n== Migration from a single-repository setup (Mercurial) #MigrationMercurial\nThe following procedure illustrates a typical migration from a Mercurial single-repository setup to multiple repositories. Please note that at the time of writing, no initial resynchronization or any hooks are necessary for Mercurial repositories - see [trac:ticket:9485 #9485] for more information.\n\n 1. Upgrade to the latest version of the [trac:TracMercurial] plugin.\n 1. Remove the default repository specification from the `[trac] repository_dir` option.\n 1. Add the main repository as a named repository.\n 1. Add an alias to the main repository as the default repository (by leaving out the the `name`, e.g. `.alias = main`). This ensures that all links predating the migration still resolve to the main repository.\n 1. Repeat step 3 to add other \"named\" repositories as needed.\n\n== Troubleshooting\n\n=== My trac-post-commit-hook doesn\'t work anymore #trac-post-commit-hook\n\nYou must now use the optional components from `tracopt.ticket.commit_updater.*`, which you can activate through the Plugins panel in the Administrative part of the web interface, or by directly modifying the [TracIni#components-section \"[components]\"] section in the trac.ini. Be sure to use [#ExplicitSync explicit synchronization] as explained above.\n',NULL,NULL),('TracRevisionLog',1,1629200947659056,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Viewing Revision Logs =\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nWhen you browse the repository, it is always possible to view the \'\'Revision Log\'\' that corresponds to the repository path. This displays a list of the most recent changesets in which the current path or any other path below it has been modified.\n\n== The Revision Log Form ==\n\nIt is possible to set the revision at which the revision log should start, using the \'\'View log starting at\'\' field. An empty value or a value of \'\'head\'\' is interpreted as the newest changeset. \n\nIt is also possible to specify the revision at which the log should stop, using the \'\'Back to\'\' field. By default it is empty, \nwhich means the revision log will show the latest 100 revisions.\n\nAlso, there are three modes of operation of the revision log.\n\nBy default, the revision log \'\'stops on copy\'\', which means that whenever an \'\'Add\'\', \'\'Copy\'\' or \'\'Rename\'\' operation is detected, no older revision will be shown. That\'s very convenient when working with branches, as one only sees the history corresponding to what has been done on the branch.\n\nIt is also possible to indicate that one wants to see what happened before a \'\'Copy\'\' or \'\'Rename\'\' change, by selecting the \n\'\'Follow copies\'\' mode. This will cross all copies or renames changes.\nEach time the name of the path changes, there will be an additional indentation level. That way, the changes on the different paths are easily grouped together visually.\n\nIt is even possible to go past an \'\'Add\'\' change, in order to see if there has been a \'\'Delete\'\' change on that path, before \nthat \'\'Add\'\'. This mode corresponds to the mode called \'\'Show only adds, moves and deletes\'\'. This operation can be quite resource intensive and therefore take some time to be shown on screen.\n\nFinally, there\'s also a checkbox \'\'Show full log messages\'\', which controls whether the full content of the commit log message\nshould be displayed for each change, or only a shortened version of it.\n\n== The Revision Log Information ==\n\nFor each revision log entry, the following columns are displayed:\n 1. The first column contains a pair of radio buttons and should be used \n    for selecting the \'\'old\'\' and the \'\'new\'\' revisions that will be \n    used for [wiki:TracRevisionLog#viewingtheactualchanges viewing the actual changes].\n 1. A color code (similar to the one used for the\n    [wiki:TracChangeset#ChangesetHeader changesets]) indicating kind of change.\n    Clicking on this column refreshes the revision log so that it restarts\n    with this change.\n 1. The \'\'\'Revision\'\'\' number, displayed as `@xyz`.\n    This is a link to the TracBrowser, using the displayed revision as the base line.\n Next to it, you can see a little \"wheel\" icon [[Image(htdocs:../common/changeset.png)]],  which is clickable and leads to the TracChangeset view for that revision.\n 1. The \'\'\'Date\'\'\' at which the change was made.\n    The date is displayed as the time elapsed from the date of the revision. The time\n    elapsed is displayed as the number of hours, days, weeks, months, or years.\n 1. The \'\'\'Author\'\'\' of the change.\n 1. The \'\'\'Log Message\'\'\', which contains either the truncated or full commit \n    log message, depending on the value of the \'\'Show full log messages\'\' \n    checkbox in the form above.\n    \n\n== Inspecting Changes Between Revisions ==\n\nThe \'\'View changes...\'\' buttons (placed above and below the list of changes, on the left side) will show the set of differences\ncorresponding to the aggregated changes starting from the \'\'old\'\' revision (first radio-button) to the \'\'new\'\' revision (second\nradio-button), in the TracChangeset view.\n\nNote that the \'\'old\'\' revision doesn\'t need to be actually \'\'older\'\' than the \'\'new\'\' revision: it simply gives a base\nfor the diff. It\'s therefore entirely possible to easily generate a \'\'reverse diff\'\', for reverting what has been done\nin the given range of revisions.\n\nFinally, if the two revisions are identical, the corresponding changeset will be shown. This has the same effect as clicking on the !ChangeSet number.\n\n== Alternative Formats ==\n\n=== The !ChangeLog Text ===\n\nAt the bottom of the page, there\'s a \'\'!ChangeLog\'\' link that will show the range of revisions as currently shown, but as a simple text, matching the usual conventions for !ChangeLog files.\n\n=== RSS Support ===\n\nThe revision log also provides a RSS feed to monitor the changes.

The roadmap can be filtered to show or hide \'\'completed milestones\'\' and \'\'milestones with no due date\'\'. In the case that both \'\'show completed milestones\'\' and \'\'hide milestones with no due date\'\' are selected, \'\'completed\'\' milestones with no due date will be shown.\n\n== The Milestone View\n\nA milestone is a future timeframe in which tickets are expected to be solved. You can add a description to milestones (using WikiFormatting) describing main objectives, for example. In addition, tickets targeted for a milestone are aggregated, and the ratio between active and resolved tickets is displayed as a milestone progress bar. It is possible to further [trac:TracRoadmapCustomGroups customise the ticket grouping] and have multiple ticket statuses shown on the progress bar.\n\nIt is possible to drill down into this simple statistic by viewing the individual milestone pages. By default, the active/resolved ratio will be grouped and displayed by component. You can also regroup the status by other criteria, such as ticket owner or severity. Ticket numbers are linked to [wiki:TracQuery custom queries] listing corresponding tickets.\n\n== Roadmap Administration\n\nWith appropriate permissions it is possible to add, modify and remove milestones using either the web interface (roadmap and milestone pages), web administration interface or by using `trac-admin`. \n\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' Milestone descriptions can not currently be edited using `trac-admin`.\n\n== iCalendar Support\n\nThe Roadmap supports the [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt iCalendar] format to keep track of planned milestones and related tickets from your favorite calendar software. Many calendar applications support the iCalendar specification including:\n * [http://www.apple.com/ical/ Apple iCal] for Mac OS X.\n * [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/ Mozilla Calendar], cross-platform.\n * [http://kontact.kde.org/korganizer/ Korganizer], the calendar application of the [http://www.kde.org/ KDE] project.\n * [https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution Evolution], a contact manager, address manager and calendar for Gnome.\n * [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/ Microsoft Outlook] can also read iCalendar files and appears as a new static calendar in Outlook.\n * [https://www.google.com/calendar/ Google Calendar].\n * [http://chandlerproject.org Chandler], a personal and small-group task management and calendaring tool, Apache licensed and orphaned since 2009.\n\nTo subscribe to the roadmap, copy the iCalendar link from the roadmap (found at the bottom of the page) and choose the \"Subscribe to remote calendar\" action (or similar) of your calendar application, and insert the URL just copied.\n\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' For tickets to be included in the calendar as tasks, you need to be logged in when copying the link.

It provides convenient access to the search module from all pages.\n\nThe search results show the most recent modifications ranked first rather than the most relevant result.\n\n== Quick searches\n\nFor quick access to project resources, the quick-search field at the top of every page can be used to enter a [TracLinks wiki link], which will take you directly to the resource identified by that link:\n\n * ![42] -- Opens change set 42\n * !#42 -- Opens ticket number 42\n * !{1} -- Opens report 1\n * /trunk -- Opens the browser for the `trunk` directory in the default repository\n * /repos1/trunk -- Opens the browser for the `trunk` directory in the `repos1` repository\n\nTo disable the Quickjump feature for a keyword start the query with an exclamation mark (`!`): use `!TracGuide` to search for occurrences of the literal word !TracGuide.\n\n== Search TracLinks\n\nFrom the Wiki, it is possible to link to a specific search, using `search:` links:\n * `search:?q=crash` will search for the string \"crash\" \n * `search:?q=trac+link&wiki=on` will search for \"trac\" and \"link\" in wiki pages only\n\n----\nSee also: TracGuide, TracLinks, TracQuery',NULL,NULL),('TracStandalone',1,1629200947722810,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Tracd\n\nTracd is a lightweight standalone Trac web server.\nIt can be used in a variety of situations, from a test or development server to a multiprocess setup behind another web server used as a load balancer.\n\n== Pros\n\n * Fewer dependencies: You don\'t need to install apache or any other web-server.\n * Fast: Should be almost as fast as the [wiki:TracModPython mod_python] version (and much faster than the [wiki:TracCgi CGI]), even more so since version 0.12 where the HTTP/1.1 version of the protocol is enabled by default\n * Automatic reloading: For development, Tracd can be used in \'\'auto_reload\'\' mode, which will automatically restart the server whenever you make a change to the code (in Trac itself or in a plugin).\n\n== Cons\n\n * Fewer features: Tracd implements a very simple web-server and is not as configurable or as scalable as Apache httpd.\n * No native HTTPS support: [http://www.rickk.com/sslwrap/ sslwrap] can be used instead,\n   or [trac:wiki:STunnelTracd stunnel -- a tutorial on how to use stunnel with tracd] or Apache with mod_proxy.\n\n== Usage examples\n\nA single project on port 8080. (http://localhost:8080/)\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd -p 8080 /path/to/project\n}}}\nStrictly speaking this will make your Trac accessible to everybody from your network rather than \'\'localhost only\'\'. To truly limit it use the `--hostname` option.\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd --hostname=localhost -p 8080 /path/to/project\n}}}\nWith more than one project. (http://localhost:8080/project1/ and http://localhost:8080/project2/)\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd -p 8080 /path/to/project1 /path/to/project2\n}}}\n\nYou can\'t have the last portion of the path identical between the projects since Trac uses that name to keep the URLs of the\ndifferent projects unique. So if you use `/project1/path/to` and `/project2/path/to`, you will only see the second project.\n\nAn alternative way to serve multiple projects is to specify a parent directory in which each subdirectory is a Trac project, using the `-e` option. The example above could be rewritten:\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd -p 8080 -e /path/to\n}}}\n\nTo exit the server on Windows, be sure to use `CTRL-BREAK` -- using `CTRL-C` will leave a Python process running in the background.\n\n== Installing as a Windows Service\n\n=== Option 1\nTo install as a Windows service, get the [http://www.google.com/search?q=srvany.exe SRVANY] utility and run:\n{{{#!cmd\n C:\\path\\to\\instsrv.exe tracd C:\\path\\to\\srvany.exe\n reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\tracd\\Parameters /v Application /d \"\\\"C:\\path\\to\\python.exe\\\" \\\"C:\\path\\to\\python\\scripts\\tracd-script.py\\\" <your tracd parameters>\"\n net start tracd\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'DO NOT\'\'\' use {{{tracd.exe}}}.  Instead register {{{python.exe}}} directly with {{{tracd-script.py}}} as a parameter.  If you use {{{tracd.exe}}}, it will spawn the python process without SRVANY\'s knowledge.  This python process will survive a {{{net stop tracd}}}.\n\nIf you want tracd to start automatically when you boot Windows, do:\n{{{#!cmd\n sc config tracd start= auto\n}}}\n\nThe spacing here is important.\n\n{{{#!div\nOnce the service is installed, it might be simpler to run the Registry Editor rather than use the `reg add` command documented above.  Navigate to:[[BR]]\n`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\tracd\\Parameters`\n\nThree (string) parameters are provided:\n||!AppDirectory ||C:\\Python26\\ ||\n||Application ||python.exe ||\n||!AppParameters ||scripts\\tracd-script.py -p 8080 ... ||\n\nNote that, if the !AppDirectory is set as above, the paths of the executable \'\'and\'\' of the script name and parameter values are relative to the directory.  This makes updating Python a little simpler because the change can be limited, here, to a single point.\n(This is true for the path to the .htpasswd file, as well, despite the documentation calling out the /full/path/to/htpasswd; however, you may not wish to store that file under the Python directory.)\n}}}\n\nFor Windows 7 User, srvany.exe may not be an option, so you can use [http://www.google.com/search?q=winserv.exe WINSERV] utility and run:\n{{{#!cmd\n\"C:\\path\\to\\winserv.exe\" install tracd -displayname \"tracd\" -start auto \"C:\\path\\to\\python.exe\" c:\\path\\to\\python\\scripts\\tracd-script.py <your tracd parameters>\"\nnet start tracd\n}}}\n\n=== Option 2\n\nUse [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/WindowsServiceScript WindowsServiceScript], available at [http://trac-hacks.org/ Trac Hacks]. Installs, removes, starts, stops, etc. your Trac service.\n\n=== Option 3\n\nalso cygwin\'s cygrunsrv.exe can be used:\n{{{#!sh\n$ cygrunsrv --install tracd --path /cygdrive/c/Python27/Scripts/tracd.exe --args \'--port 8000 --env-parent-dir E:\\IssueTrackers\\Trac\\Projects\'\n$ net start tracd\n}}}\n\n== Using Authentication\n\nTracd allows you to run Trac without the need for Apache, but you can take advantage of Apache\'s password tools (`htpasswd` and `htdigest`) to easily create a password file in the proper format for tracd to use in authentication. (It is also possible to create the password file without `htpasswd` or `htdigest`; see below for alternatives)\n\n{{{#!div style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n**Attention:** Make sure you place the generated password files on a filesystem which supports sub-second timestamps, as Trac will monitor their modified time and changes happening on a filesystem with too coarse-grained timestamp resolution (like `ext2` or `ext3` on Linux, or HFS+ on OSX).\n}}}\n\nTracd provides support for both Basic and Digest authentication. Digest is considered more secure. The examples below use Digest; to use Basic authentication, replace `--auth` with `--basic-auth` in the command line.\n\nThe general format for using authentication is:\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd -p port --auth=\"base_project_dir,password_file_path,realm\" project_path\n}}}\nwhere:\n * \'\'\'base_project_dir\'\'\': the base directory of the project specified as follows:\n   * when serving multiple projects: \'\'relative\'\' to the `project_path`\n   * when serving only a single project (`-s`): the name of the project directory\n Don\'t use an absolute path here as this won\'t work. \'\'Note:\'\' This parameter is case-sensitive even for environments on Windows.\n * \'\'\'password_file_path\'\'\': path to the password file\n * \'\'\'realm\'\'\': the realm name (can be anything)\n * \'\'\'project_path\'\'\': path of the project\n\n * **`--auth`** in the above means use Digest authentication, replace `--auth` with `--basic-auth` if you want to use Basic auth.  Although Basic authentication does not require a \"realm\", the command parser does, so the second comma is required, followed directly by the closing quote for an empty realm name.\n\nExamples:\n\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd -p 8080 \\\n   --auth=\"project1,/path/to/passwordfile,mycompany.com\" /path/to/project1\n}}}\n\nOf course, the password file can be be shared so that it is used for more than one project:\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd -p 8080 \\\n   --auth=\"project1,/path/to/passwordfile,mycompany.com\" \\\n   --auth=\"project2,/path/to/passwordfile,mycompany.com\" \\\n   /path/to/project1 /path/to/project2\n}}}\n\nAnother way to share the password file is to specify \"*\" for the project name:\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd -p 8080 \\\n   --auth=\"*,/path/to/users.htdigest,mycompany.com\" \\\n   /path/to/project1 /path/to/project2\n}}}\n\n=== Basic Authorization: Using a htpasswd password file\nThis section describes how to use `tracd` with Apache .htpasswd files.\n\n  Note: On Windows It is necessary to install the fcrypt package in order to\n  decode some htpasswd formats. Only `SHA-1` passwords (since Trac 1.0) work\n  without this module.\n\nTo create a .htpasswd file use Apache\'s `htpasswd` command (see [#GeneratingPasswordsWithoutApache below] for a method to create these files without using Apache):\n{{{#!sh\n $ sudo htpasswd -c /path/to/env/.htpasswd username\n}}}\nthen for additional users:\n{{{#!sh\n $ sudo htpasswd /path/to/env/.htpasswd username2\n}}}\n\nThen to start `tracd` run something like this:\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd -p 8080 --basic-auth=\"project,/fullpath/environmentname/.htpasswd,realmname\" /path/to/project\n}}}\n\nFor example:\n{{{#!sh\n $ tracd -p 8080 --basic-auth=\"project,/srv/tracenv/testenv/.htpasswd,My Test Env\" /path/to/project\n}}}\n\'\'Note:\'\' You might need to pass \"-m\" as a parameter to htpasswd on some platforms (OpenBSD).\n\n=== Digest authentication: Using a htdigest password file\n\nIf you have Apache available, you can use the htdigest command to generate the password file. Type \'htdigest\' to get some usage instructions, or read [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/htdigest.html this page] from the Apache manual to get precise instructions.  You\'ll be prompted for a password to enter for each user that you create.  For the name of the password file, you can use whatever you like, but if you use something like `users.htdigest` it will remind you what the file contains. As a suggestion, put it in your <projectname>/conf folder along with the [TracIni trac.ini] file.\n\nNote that you can start tracd without the `--auth` argument, but if you click on the \'\'Login\'\' link you will get an error.\n\n=== Generating Passwords Without Apache\n\nBasic Authorization can be accomplished via this [http://aspirine.org/htpasswd_en.html online HTTP Password generator] which also supports `SHA-1`.  Copy the generated password-hash line to the .htpasswd file on your system. Note that Windows Python lacks the \"crypt\" module that is the default hash type for htpasswd. Windows Python can grok MD5 password hashes just fine and you should use MD5.\n\nTrac also provides `htpasswd` and `htdigest` scripts in `contrib`:\n{{{#!sh\n$ ./contrib/htpasswd.py -cb htpasswd user1 user1\n$ ./contrib/htpasswd.py -b htpasswd user2 user2\n}}}\n\n{{{#!sh\n$ ./contrib/htdigest.py -cb htdigest trac user1 user1\n$ ./contrib/htdigest.py -b htdigest trac user2 user2\n}}}\n\n==== Using `md5sum`\nIt is possible to use `md5sum` utility to generate digest-password file:\n{{{#!sh\nuser=\nrealm=\npassword=\npath_to_file=\necho ${user}:${realm}:$(printf \"${user}:${realm}:${password}\" | md5sum - | sed -e \'s/\\s\\+-//\') > ${path_to_file}\n}}}\n\n== Reference\n\nHere\'s the online help, as a reminder (`tracd --help`):\n{{{\nUsage: tracd [options] [projenv] ...\n\nOptions:\n  --version             show program\'s version number and exit\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -a DIGESTAUTH, --auth=DIGESTAUTH\n                        [projectdir],[htdigest_file],[realm]\n  --basic-auth=BASICAUTH\n                        [projectdir],[htpasswd_file],[realm]\n  -p PORT, --port=PORT  the port number to bind to\n  -b HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME\n                        the host name or IP address to bind to\n  --protocol=PROTOCOL   http|scgi|ajp|fcgi\n  -q, --unquote         unquote PATH_INFO (may be needed when using ajp)\n  --http10              use HTTP/1.0 protocol version instead of HTTP/1.1\n  --http11              use HTTP/1.1 protocol version (default)\n  -e PARENTDIR, --env-parent-dir=PARENTDIR\n                        parent directory of the project environments\n  --base-path=BASE_PATH\n                        the initial portion of the request URL\'s \"path\"\n  -r, --auto-reload     restart automatically when sources are modified\n  -s, --single-env      only serve a single project without the project list\n  -d, --daemonize       run in the background as a daemon\n  --pidfile=PIDFILE     when daemonizing, file to which to write pid\n  --umask=MASK          when daemonizing, file mode creation mask to use, in\n                        octal notation (default 022)\n  --group=GROUP         the group to run as\n  --user=USER           the user to run as\n}}}\n\nUse the -d option so that tracd doesn\'t hang if you close the terminal window where tracd was started.\n\n== Tips\n\n=== Serving static content\n\nIf `tracd` is the only web server used for the project, \nit can also be used to distribute static content \n(tarballs, Doxygen documentation, etc.)\n\nThis static content should be put in the `$TRAC_ENV/htdocs` folder,\nand is accessed by URLs like `<project_URL>/chrome/site/...`.\n\nExample: given a `$TRAC_ENV/htdocs/software-0.1.tar.gz` file,\nthe corresponding relative URL would be `/<project_name>/chrome/site/software-0.1.tar.gz`, \nwhich in turn can be written as `htdocs:software-0.1.tar.gz` (TracLinks syntax) or `[/<project_name>/chrome/site/software-0.1.tar.gz]` (relative link syntax).\n\n=== Using tracd behind a proxy\n\nIn some situations when you choose to use tracd behind Apache or another web server.\n\nIn this situation, you might experience issues with redirects, like being redirected to URLs with the wrong host or protocol. In this case (and only in this case), setting the `[trac] use_base_url_for_redirect` to `true` can help, as this will force Trac to use the value of `[trac] base_url` for doing the redirects.\n\nIf you\'re using the AJP protocol to connect with `tracd` (which is possible if you have flup installed), then you might experience problems with double quoting. Consider adding the `--unquote` parameter.\n\nSee also [trac:TracOnWindowsIisAjp], [trac:TracNginxRecipe].\n\n=== Authentication for tracd behind a proxy\nIt is convenient to provide central external authentication to your tracd instances, instead of using `--basic-auth`. There is some discussion about this in [trac:#9206].\n\nBelow is example configuration based on Apache 2.2, mod_proxy, mod_authnz_ldap.\n\nFirst we bring tracd into Apache\'s location namespace.\n\n{{{#!apache\n<Location /project/proxified>\n        Require ldap-group cn=somegroup, ou=Groups,dc=domain.com\n        Require ldap-user somespecificusertoo\n        ProxyPass http://localhost:8101/project/proxified/\n        # Turns out we don\'t really need complicated RewriteRules here at all\n        RequestHeader set REMOTE_USER %{REMOTE_USER}s\n</Location>\n}}}\n\nThen we need a single file plugin to recognize HTTP_REMOTE_USER header as valid authentication source. HTTP headers like \'\'\'HTTP_FOO_BAR\'\'\' will get converted to \'\'\'Foo-Bar\'\'\' during processing. Name it something like \'\'\'remote-user-auth.py\'\'\' and drop it into \'\'\'proxified/plugins\'\'\' directory:\n{{{#!python\nfrom trac.core import *\nfrom trac.config import BoolOption\nfrom trac.web.api import IAuthenticator\n\nclass MyRemoteUserAuthenticator(Component):\n\n    implements(IAuthenticator)\n\n    obey_remote_user_header = BoolOption(\'trac\', \'obey_remote_user_header\', \'false\', \n               \"\"\"Whether the \'Remote-User:\' HTTP header is to be trusted for user logins \n                (\'\'since ??.??\').\"\"\") \n\n    def authenticate(self, req):\n        if self.obey_remote_user_header and req.get_header(\'Remote-User\'): \n            return req.get_header(\'Remote-User\') \n        return None\n\n}}}\n\nAdd this new parameter to your TracIni:\n{{{#!ini\n[trac]\n...\nobey_remote_user_header = true\n...\n}}}\n\nRun tracd:\n{{{#!sh\ntracd -p 8101 -s proxified --base-path=/project/proxified\n}}}\n\nNote that if you want to install this plugin for all projects, you have to put it in your [TracPlugins#Plugindiscovery global plugins_dir] and enable it in your global trac.ini.\n\nGlobal config (e.g. `/srv/trac/conf/trac.ini`):\n{{{#!ini\n[components]\nremote-user-auth.* = enabled\n[inherit]\nplugins_dir = /srv/trac/plugins\n[trac]\nobey_remote_user_header = true\n}}}\n\nEnvironment config (e.g. `/srv/trac/envs/myenv`):\n{{{#!ini\n[inherit]\nfile = /srv/trac/conf/trac.ini\n}}}\n\n=== Serving a different base path than /\nTracd supports serving projects with different base urls than /<project>.

If none of these packages is available, Trac will display the data as plain text. \n\n== About Pygments\n\nPygments is a highlighting library implemented in pure Python, very fast, easy to extend and [http://pygments.org/docs/ well documented].\n\nThe Pygments default style can specified in the [TracIni#mimeviewer-section mime-viewer] section of your TracIni file. The default style can be overridden by setting a Style preference on the [/prefs/pygments preferences page]. \n\nThe list below contains only the most commonly used processors and the [http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/ list of supported Pygments lexers] is growing weekly.\n\n== Syntax Coloring Support\n\n=== Known MIME Types\n\n[[KnownMimeTypes]]\n\nNote that the rich content may be directly //rendered// instead of syntax highlighted. This usually depends on which auxiliary packages are installed and on which components are activated in your setup. For example a `text/x-rst` document will be rendered via `docutils` if it is installed and the `trac.mimeview.rst.ReStructuredTextRenderer` is not disabled, and will be syntax highlighted otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, a document with the mimetype `text/x-trac-wiki` is rendered using the Trac wiki formatter, unless the `trac.mimeview.api.WikiTextRenderer` component is disabled.\n\nHTML documents are directly rendered only if the `render_unsafe_html` settings are enabled in your TracIni file. Those settings are present in multiple sections, as there are different security concerns depending where the document comes from. If you want to ensure that an HTML document gets syntax highlighted and not rendered, use the `text/xml` mimetype.\n\nIf a mimetype property such as `svn:mime-type` is set to `text/plain`, there is no coloring even if the file is of a known type, like `java`.\n\n=== List of Languages Supported, by Highlighter #language-supported\n\nThis list is only indicative.\n\n||                 ||= !SilverCity   =||= Enscript      =||= Pygments =||\n|| Ada             ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| Asm             ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| Apache Conf     ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| ASP             ||  ✓              ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| C               ||  ✓              ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| C#              ||                 ||  ✓ ^[#a1 (1)]^  ||  ✓  ||\n|| C++             ||  ✓              ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| CMake           ||  ?              ||  ?              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Java            ||  ✓ ^[#a2 (2)]^  ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Awk             ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| Boo             ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| CSS             ||  ✓              ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| Python Doctests ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| Diff            ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Eiffel          ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| Elisp           ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| Fortran         ||                 ||  ✓ ^[#a1 (1)]^  ||  ✓  ||\n|| Haskell         ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Genshi          ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| HTML            ||  ✓              ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| IDL             ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| INI             ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| Javascript      ||  ✓              ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Lua             ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| m4              ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| Makefile        ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Mako            ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| Matlab ^[#a3 (3)]^  ||             ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Mygthy          ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| Objective-C     ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| OCaml           ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| Pascal          ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Perl            ||  ✓              ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| PHP             ||  ✓              ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| PSP             ||  ✓              ||                 ||     ||\n|| Pyrex           ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| Python          ||  ✓              ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Ruby            ||  ✓              ||  ✓ ^[#a1 (1)]^  ||  ✓  ||\n|| Scheme          ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Shell           ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Smarty          ||                 ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n|| SQL             ||  ✓              ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Troff           ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| TCL             ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| Tex             ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| Verilog         ||  ✓ ^[#a2 (2)]^  ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| VHDL            ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| Visual Basic    ||                 ||  ✓              ||  ✓  ||\n|| VRML            ||                 ||  ✓              ||     ||\n|| XML             ||  ✓              ||                 ||  ✓  ||\n\n\n\'\'[=#a1 (1)] Not included in the Enscript distribution.

All tickets can be edited, annotated, assigned, prioritized and discussed at any time.\n\n[=#edit-permissions]\nHowever, a Trac installation may place restrictions on who can change what. For example, the default installation doesn\'t permit to non-authenticated users (\"anonymous\" users) to change anything, even to comment on an issue, for obvious spam prevention reasons. Check the local contributing policy, which you can usually find on the front page of WikiStart, or contact your local Trac administrator.\n\n== Ticket Fields\n\nA ticket contains the following information:\n \n * \'\'\'Reporter\'\'\' — The author of the ticket.\n * \'\'\'Type\'\'\' — The category of the ticket. The default types are `defect`, `enhancement` and `task`. \n * \'\'\'Component\'\'\' — The project module or subsystem that this ticket concerns.\n * \'\'\'Version\'\'\' — Version of the project that this ticket pertains to.\n * \'\'\'Keywords\'\'\' — Keywords that a ticket is tagged with. Useful for searching and report generation.\n * \'\'\'Priority\'\'\' — The importance of this issue, ranging from \'\'trivial\'\' to \'\'blocker\'\'. A dropdown list when multiple priorities are defined.\n * \'\'\'Milestone\'\'\' — Due date of when this issue should be resolved. A dropdown list containing the milestones.\n * \'\'\'Assigned to/Owner\'\'\' — Principal person responsible for handling the issue.\n * \'\'\'Cc\'\'\' — A comma-separated list of other users or email addresses to notify. Note that this does not imply responsibility or any other policy.\n * \'\'\'Resolution\'\'\' — Reason for why a ticket was closed. One of {{{fixed}}}, {{{invalid}}}, {{{wontfix}}}, {{{duplicate}}}, {{{worksforme}}}.\n * \'\'\'Status\'\'\' — What is the current status? The statuses are defined in the [TracWorkflow#BasicTicketWorkflowCustomization ticket workflow]. For the default workflow the statuses are `new`, `assigned`, `accepted`, `closed` and `reopened`.\n * \'\'\'Summary\'\'\' — A description summarizing the issue. Simple text without WikiFormatting.\n * \'\'\'Description\'\'\' — The body of the ticket. A good description should be specific, descriptive and to the point. Accepts WikiFormatting.\n\n\'\'\'Notes:\'\'\' \n - Versions of Trac prior to 0.9 did not have the \'\'type\'\' field, but instead provided a \'\'severity\'\' field and different default values for the \'\'priority\'\' field. This change was done to simplify the ticket model by removing the somewhat blurry distinction between \'\'priority\'\' and \'\'severity\'\'. However, the old model is still available if you prefer it: just add/modify the default values of the \'\'priority\'\' and \'\'severity\'\', and optionally hide the \'\'type\'\' field by removing all the possible values through [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin].\n\n - The [trac:TicketTypes type], [trac:TicketComponent component], version, priority and severity fields can be managed with [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] or with the [trac:WebAdmin WebAdmin] plugin.\n\n - Description of the builtin \'\'priority\'\' values is available at [trac:TicketTypes#Whyistheseverityfieldgone TicketTypes]\n\n== Changing and Commenting Tickets\n\nWith appropriate permissions, as already mentioned [#edit-permissions above], a ticket entered into Trac can at any time be modified by \'\'\'annotating\'\'\'.\n\nThen, annotations like changes and comments to the ticket are logged as a part of the ticket itself. When viewing a ticket, the history of changes will appear below the main ticket area.\n\nComment editing (available since 0.12) is meant to be used to make small corrections to comments, like fixing formatting, forgotten WikiFormatting or spelling errors, not major edits. For longer edits, you should be adding a new comment instead. Editing a comment will not produce a new entry on [/timeline], while entering a new comment or other changes will do.\n\nAll edits (field changes, new comments, comment edits) update the \"last changed\" time of the ticket.\n\n\'\'\'Notes:\'\'\' \n - An important feature is being able to use TracLinks and WikiFormatting in ticket descriptions and comments. Use TracLinks to refer to other issues, changesets or files to make your ticket more specific and easier to understand.\n\n - See TracNotification for how to configure email notifications of ticket changes.\n\n - See TracWorkflow for information about the state transitions (ticket lifecycle), and how this workflow can be customized.\n\n== Default Values for Drop-Down Fields\n\nThe option selected by default for the various drop-down fields can be set in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini], in the `[ticket]` section:\n\n * `default_component`: Name of the component selected by default.\n * `default_milestone`: Name of the default milestone.\n * `default_priority`: Default priority value.\n * `default_severity`: Default severity value.\n * `default_type`: Default ticket type.\n * `default_version`: Name of the default version.\n * `default_owner`: Name of the default owner. If set to the text `< default >` (the default value), the component owner is used.\n\nIf any of these options are omitted, the default value will either be the first in the list, or an empty value, depending on whether the field in question is required to be set. Some of these can be chosen through the [trac:WebAdmin WebAdmin] plugin in the \"Ticket System\" section, others can be set in the [[wiki:TracIni#ticket-section|\"[ticket]\"]] section in `trac.ini`.\n\n== Hiding Fields and Adding Custom Fields\n\nMany of the default ticket fields can be hidden from the ticket web interface simply by removing all the possible values through [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin]. This of course only applies to drop-down fields, such as \'\'type\'\', \'\'priority\'\', \'\'severity\'\', \'\'component\'\', \'\'version\'\' and \'\'milestone\'\'.\n\nTrac also lets you add your own custom ticket fields. See TracTicketsCustomFields for more information.\n\n== Assign-to as Drop-Down List\n\nIf the list of possible ticket owners is finite, you can change the \'\'assign-to\'\' ticket field from a text input to a drop-down list. This is done by setting the `restrict_owner` option of the `[ticket]` section in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini] to `true`. In that case, Trac will populate the list with all users who **have an authenticated session** and possess the `TICKET_MODIFY` [TracPermissions permissions].\n\nAn authenticated session will be created the first time a user authenticates with the project. You can manually add an authenticated session using the [\"TracAdmin#?session add\" trac-admin] `session add` command. The `:1` suffix on the session id (i.e. username) is the key to creating an authenticated session:\n{{{#!sh\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv session add <sid>:1 [name] [email]\n}}}\n\nYou may find the dropdown list is //overpopulated// with users that are no longer active in the project. Revoking authentication privileges will not remove the session data that is used to populate the dropdown list. The [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] command can be used to list and remove sessions:\n\n - List all sessions:\n{{{#!sh\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv session list\n}}}\n - Remove a session:\n{{{#!sh\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv session delete SID\n}}}\n\nAlternatively, you can just revoke `TICKET_MODIFY` from users that you don\'t want to be included in the list. However, that will not be possible if you\'ve granted `TICKET_MODIFY` to all //anonymous// or //authenticated// users.\n\n\'\'\'Notes:\'\'\'\n - If you need more flexibility and aren\'t afraid of a little plugin coding of your own, see the [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/FlexibleAssignToPlugin FlexibleAssignTo plugin].\n \n - Activating this option may cause some performance degradation. Read more about this in the [trac:TracPerformance#Configuration Trac performance] page.\n\n== Preset Values for New Tickets\n\nTo create a link to the new-ticket form filled with preset values, you need to call the `/newticket?` URL with `variable=value` separated by `&`. Possible variables are:\n\n * \'\'\'type\'\'\' — The type droplist.\n * \'\'\'reporter\'\'\' — Name or email of the reporter.\n * \'\'\'summary\'\'\' — Summary line for the ticket.\n * \'\'\'description\'\'\' — Long description of the ticket.\n * \'\'\'component\'\'\' — The component dropdown list.\n * \'\'\'version\'\'\' — The version dropdown list.\n * \'\'\'severity\'\'\' — The severity dropdown list.\n * \'\'\'keywords\'\'\' — The keywords or tags.\n * \'\'\'priority\'\'\' — The priority dropdown list.\n * \'\'\'milestone\'\'\' — The milestone dropdown list.\n * \'\'\'owner\'\'\' — The person responsible for the ticket.\n * \'\'\'cc\'\'\' — The list of emails for notifying about the ticket change.\n\nExample: `[/newticket?summary=Compile%20Error&version=1.0&component=gui]`\n\n----\nSee also: TracGuide, TracWiki, TracTicketsCustomFields, TracNotification, TracReports, TracQuery',NULL,NULL),('TracTicketsCustomFields',1,1629200947649505,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Custom Ticket Fields\n\nTrac supports adding custom, user-defined fields to the ticket module. Using custom fields, you can add typed, site-specific properties to tickets.\n\n== Configuration\n\nConfiguring custom ticket fields is done in the [wiki:TracIni trac.ini] file. All field definitions should be under a section named `[ticket-custom]`.\n\nThe syntax of each field definition is:\n{{{\n FIELD_NAME = TYPE\n (FIELD_NAME.OPTION = VALUE)\n ...\n}}}\n\nThe example below should help to explain the syntax.\n\n=== Available Field Types and Options\n\n * \'\'\'text\'\'\': A simple (one line) text field.\n   * label: Descriptive label.\n   * value: Default value.\n   * order: Sort order placement. Determines relative placement in forms with respect to other custom fields.\n   * format: One of: \n     * `plain` for plain text \n     * `wiki` to interpret the content as WikiFormatting\n     * `reference` to treat the content as a queryable value (\'\'since 1.0\'\') \n     * `list` to interpret the content as a list of queryable values, separated by whitespace (\'\'since 1.0\'\')\n * \'\'\'checkbox\'\'\': A boolean value check box.\n   * label: Descriptive label.\n   * value: Default value: 0 or 1.\n   * order: Sort order placement.\n * \'\'\'select\'\'\': Drop-down select box. Uses a list of values.\n   * label: Descriptive label.\n   * options: List of values, separated by \'\'\'|\'\'\' (vertical pipe).\n   * value: Default value (one of the values from options).\n   * order: Sort order placement.\n * \'\'\'radio\'\'\': Radio buttons. Essentially the same as \'\'\'select\'\'\'.\n   * label: Descriptive label.\n   * options: List of values, separated by \'\'\'|\'\'\' (vertical pipe).\n   * value: Default value (one of the values from options).\n   * order: Sort order placement.\n * \'\'\'textarea\'\'\': Multi-line text area.\n   * label: Descriptive label.\n   * value: Default text.\n   * cols: Width in columns\n   * rows: Height in lines.\n   * order: Sort order placement.\n   * format: Either `plain` for plain text or `wiki` to interpret the content as WikiFormatting.\n\nMacros will be expanded when rendering `textarea` fields with format `wiki`, but not when rendering `text` fields with format `wiki`.\n\n=== Sample Configuration\n\n{{{#!ini\n[ticket-custom]\n\ntest_one = text\ntest_one.label = Just a text box\n\ntest_two = text\ntest_two.label = Another text-box\ntest_two.value = Default [mailto:joe@nospam.com owner]\ntest_two.format = wiki\n\ntest_three = checkbox\ntest_three.label = Some checkbox\ntest_three.value = 1\n\ntest_four = select\ntest_four.label = My selectbox\ntest_four.options = one|two|third option|four\ntest_four.value = two\n\ntest_five = radio\ntest_five.label = Radio buttons are fun\ntest_five.options = uno|dos|tres|cuatro|cinco\ntest_five.value = dos\n\ntest_six = textarea\ntest_six.label = This is a large textarea\ntest_six.value = Default text\ntest_six.cols = 60\ntest_six.rows = 30\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': To make entering an option for a `select` type field optional, specify a leading `|` in the `fieldname.options` option.\n\n=== Reports Involving Custom Fields\n\nCustom ticket fields are stored in the `ticket_custom` table, not in the `ticket` table. So to display the values from custom fields in a report, you will need a join on the 2 tables. Let\'s use an example with a custom ticket field called `progress`.\n\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT p.value AS __color__,\n   id AS ticket, summary, owner, c.value AS progress\n  FROM ticket t, enum p, ticket_custom c\n  WHERE status IN (\'assigned\') AND t.id = c.ticket AND c.name = \'progress\'\nAND p.name = t.priority AND p.type = \'priority\'\n  ORDER BY p.value\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': This will only show tickets that have progress set in them, which is \'\'\'not the same as showing all tickets\'\'\'. If you created this custom ticket field \'\'after\'\' you have already created some tickets, they will not have that field defined, and thus they will never show up on this ticket query. If you go back and modify those tickets, the field will be defined, and they will appear in the query. If that is all that is required, you\'re set.\n\nHowever, if you want to show all ticket entries (with progress defined and without), you need to use a `JOIN` for every custom field that is in the query:\n{{{#!sql\nSELECT p.value AS __color__,\n   id AS ticket, summary, component, version, milestone, severity,\n   (CASE status WHEN \'assigned\' THEN owner||\' *\' ELSE owner END) AS owner,\n   time AS created,\n   changetime AS _changetime, description AS _description,\n   reporter AS _reporter,\n   (CASE WHEN c.value = \'0\' THEN \'None\' ELSE c.value END) AS progress\n  FROM ticket t\n     LEFT OUTER JOIN ticket_custom c ON (t.id = c.ticket AND c.name = \'progress\')\n     JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type=\'priority\'\n  WHERE status IN (\'new\', \'assigned\', \'reopened\')\n  ORDER BY p.value, milestone, severity, time\n}}}\n\nNote in particular the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` statement here.\n\nNote that if your config file uses an \'\'\'uppercase\'\'\' name:\n{{{#!ini\n[ticket-custom]\n\nProgress_Type = text\n}}}\nyou would use \'\'\'lowercase\'\'\' in the SQL: `AND c.name = \'progress_type\'`.\n\n=== Updating the database\n\nAs noted above, any tickets created before a custom field has been defined will not have a value for that field. Here is some SQL (tested with SQLite) that you can run directly on the Trac database to set an initial value for custom ticket fields. It inserts the default value of \'None\' into a custom field called \'request_source\' for all tickets that have no existing value:\n\n{{{#!sql\nINSERT INTO ticket_custom\n   (ticket, name, value)\n   SELECT \n      id AS ticket,\n      \'request_source\' AS name,\n      \'None\' AS value\n   FROM ticket \n   WHERE id NOT IN (\n      SELECT ticket FROM ticket_custom\n   );\n}}}\n\nIf you added multiple custom fields at different points in time, you should be more specific in the subquery on table {{{ticket}}} by adding the exact custom field name to the query:\n\n{{{#!sql\nINSERT INTO ticket_custom\n   (ticket, name, value)\n   SELECT \n      id AS ticket,\n      \'request_source\' AS name,\n      \'None\' AS value\n   FROM ticket \n   WHERE id NOT IN (\n      SELECT ticket FROM ticket_custom WHERE name = \'request_source\'\n   );\n}}}\n\n----\nSee also: TracTickets, TracIni',NULL,NULL),('TracTimeline',1,1629200947744704,'trac','127.0.0.1','= The Trac Timeline =\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nTrac\'s timeline feature provides a historic view of the project in a single report.\n\nIt lists all Trac events that have occurred in chronological order, a brief description of each event and if applicable, the person responsible for the change.\n\nThe timeline lists these kinds of events:\n * \'\'\'Wiki page events\'\'\' — Creation and changes\n * \'\'\'Ticket events\'\'\' — Creation and resolution/closing and optionally other changes\n * \'\'\'Source code changes \'\'\' — Repository check-ins\n * \'\'\'Milestone \'\'\' — Milestone completed\n\nEach event entry provides a hyperlink to the specific event in question, who authored the change as well as a brief excerpt of the actual comment or text, if available.\n\nIt is possible to filter the displayed events with the various filters in the option panel:\n * \'\'View changes from\'\' — the date from which to start displaying events (current date if empty).

Bring your server off-line\n\nIt is not a good idea to update a running server: the server processes may have parts of the current packages cached in memory, and updating the code will likely trigger [#ZipImportError internal errors].\n\nAlthough a database backup will be implicitly created by default when upgrading the environment, it is always a good idea to perform a full backup of the environment using the [TracBackup hotcopy] command before beginning.\n\n=== 2. Update the Trac Code #UpdatetheTracCode\n\nGet the new version as described in TracInstall, or your operating system specific procedure.\n\nIf you already have a 0.12 version of Trac installed via `easy_install`, it might be easiest to also use `easy_install` to upgrade your Trac installation:\n\n{{{#!sh\neasy_install --upgrade Trac==1.0\n}}}\n\nIf you do a manual (not operating system-specific) upgrade, you should also stop any running Trac servers before the installation. Doing \"hot\" upgrades is not advised, especially on Windows ([trac:#7265]).\n\nYou may also want to remove the pre-existing Trac code by deleting the `trac` directory from the Python `lib/site-packages` directory, or remove Trac `.egg` files from former versions.\nThe location of the site-packages directory depends on the operating system and the location in which Python was installed. However, the following locations are typical:\n * on Linux: `/usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages`\n * on Windows: `C:\\Python2.X\\lib\\site-packages`\n * on MacOSX: `/Library/Python/2.X/site-packages`\n\nYou may also want to remove the Trac `cgi-bin`, `htdocs`, `templates` and `wiki-default` directories that are commonly found in a directory called `share/trac`. The exact location depends on your platform. This cleanup is not mandatory, but makes it easier to troubleshoot issues later on, as your installation is uncluttered by code or templates from a previous release that is not used anymore. As usual, make a backup before actually removing things.\n\n=== 3. Upgrade the Trac Environment #UpgradetheTracEnvironment\n\nEnvironment upgrades are not necessary for minor version releases unless otherwise noted. \n\nAfter restarting, Trac should show the instances which need a manual upgrade via the automated upgrade scripts to ease the pain. These scripts are run via [TracAdmin trac-admin]:\n{{{#!sh\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv upgrade\n}}}\n\nThis command will not have any effect if the environment is already up-to-date.\n\nNote that a backup of your database will be performed automatically prior to the upgrade. \nThis feature is relatively new for PostgreSQL or MySQL databases, so if it fails, you will have to backup the database manually. Then, to perform the actual upgrade:\n{{{#!sh\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv upgrade --no-backup\n}}}\n\n=== 4. Update the Trac Documentation === #UpdatetheTracDocumentation\n\nBy default, every [TracEnvironment Trac environment] includes a copy of the Trac documentation for the installed version. However, to keep the included documentation in sync with the installed version of Trac, use the following [TracAdmin trac-admin] command to upgrade the documentation:\n{{{#!sh\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv wiki upgrade\n}}}\n\nNote that this procedure will leave your `WikiStart` page intact.\n\n=== 5. Refresh static resources\n\nIf you have set up a web server to give out static resources directly (accessed using the `/chrome/` URL) then you will need to refresh them using the same command:\n{{{#!sh\ntrac-admin /path/to/env deploy /deploy/path\n}}}\n\nthis will extract static resources and CGI scripts (`trac.wsgi`, etc) from new Trac version and its plugins into `/deploy/path`.\n\nSome web browsers (IE, Opera) cache CSS and Javascript files aggressively, so you may need to instruct your users to manually erase the contents of their browser\'s cache, a forced refreshed (`<F5>`) should be enough.\n{{{#!comment\nRemove above note once #9936 is fixed.\n}}}\n\n=== 6. Steps specific to a given Trac version\n\n==== Upgrading from Trac 0.12 to Trac 1.0 #to1.0\n\n===== Python 2.4 no longer supported\n\nUpgrade Python to at least 2.5, but not 3.0.\n\n===== Obsolete Plugins\n\nTrac has added functionality equivalent to the following plugins:\n\n* [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/BatchModifyPlugin BatchModifyPlugin]\n* ​[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin GitPlugin]\n* [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/OverrideEditPlugin OverrideEditPlugin]\n\nThe plugins should be removed when upgrading Trac to 1.0.\n\n===== Subversion components not enabled by default for new installations\nThe Trac components for Subversion support are no longer enabled by default. To enable the svn support, you need to make sure the `tracopt.versioncontrol.svn` components are enabled, for example by setting the following in the TracIni:\n{{{#!ini\n[components]\ntracopt.versioncontrol.svn.* = enabled\n}}}\nThe upgrade procedure should take care of this and change the TracIni appropriately, unless you already had the svn components explicitly disabled.\n\n===== Attachments migrated to new location\nAnother step in the automatic upgrade will change the way the attachments are stored. Create a backup of the `attachments` directory before upgrading. In case the `attachments` directory contains some files which are //not// attachments, the last step of the migration to the new layout will fail: the deletion of the now unused `attachments` directory can\'t be done if there are still files and folders in it. You may ignore this error, but better to move them elsewhere and remove the `attachments` directory manually. The attachments themselves are now all located in your environment below the `files/attachments` directory.\n\n===== Behavior of `[ticket] default_owner` changed\nPrior to 1.0, the owner field of new tickets always defaulted to `[ticket] default_owner` when the value was not empty. If the value was empty, the owner field defaulted to to the Component\'s owner. In 1.0 and later, the `default_owner` must be set to `< default >` to make new tickets default to the Component\'s owner. This change allows the `default_owner` to be set to an empty value if no default owner is desired.\n\n==== Upgrading from Trac 0.11 to Trac 0.12\n\n===== Python 2.3 no longer supported\n\nThe minimum supported version of Python is now 2.4.\n\n===== SQLite v3.x required\n\nSQLite v2.x is no longer supported. If you still use a Trac database of this format, you\'ll need to convert it to SQLite v3.x first. See [trac:PySqlite#UpgradingSQLitefrom2.xto3.x] for details.\n\n===== [trac:PySqlite] 2 required\n\n[trac:PySqlite] 1.1.x is no longer supported. Please install 2.5.5 or later if possible, see [#Tracdatabaseupgrade Trac database upgrade] below.\n\n===== Obsolete Plugins\n\nTrac has added functionality equivalent to the following plugins:\n\n* [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AutoQueryPlugin AutoQueryPlugin]\n* ​[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AdminConsoleProviderPatch AdminConsoleProviderPatch]\n* [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AnchorMacro AnchorMacro]: see WikiFormatting#SettingAnchors\n* [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TicketChangePlugin TicketChangePlugin]: see [TracPermissions#TicketSystem TICKET_EDIT_COMMENT permission]\n* [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TicketDeletePlugin TicketDeletePlugin]: see `tracopt.ticket.deleter`\n* [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/SubversionLocationPlugin SubversionLocationPlugin]: see TracRepositoryAdmin#Repositories\n* [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/WikiCreoleRendererPlugin WikiCreoleRendererPlugin]: see [trac:WikiCreole]\n* [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/RepoRevisionSyntaxPlugin RepoRevisionSyntaxPlugin] (added in 0.12.1)\n\nThe plugins should be removed when upgrading Trac to 0.12.\n\n===== Multiple Repository Support\n\nThe latest version includes support for multiple repositories. If you plan to add more repositories to your Trac instance, please refer to TracRepositoryAdmin#Migration.\n\nThis may be of interest to users with only one repository, since there is now a way to avoid the potentially costly resync check at every request.\n\n===== Resynchronize the Trac Environment Against the Source Code Repository\n\nEach [TracEnvironment Trac environment] must be resynchronized against the source code repository in order to avoid errors such as \"[trac:#6120 No changeset ??? in the repository]\" while browsing the source through the Trac interface:\n\n{{{#!sh\ntrac-admin /path/to/projenv repository resync \'*\'\n}}}\n\n===== Improved repository synchronization\n\nIn addition to supporting multiple repositories, there is now a more efficient method for synchronizing Trac and your repositories.\n\nWhile you can keep the same synchronization as in 0.11 adding the post-commit hook as outlined in TracRepositoryAdmin#Synchronization and TracRepositoryAdmin#ExplicitSync will allow more efficient synchronization and is more or less required for multiple repositories.\n\nNote that if you were using the `trac-post-commit-hook`, \'\'you\'re strongly advised to upgrade it\'\' to the new hook documented in the above references and [TracWorkflow#Howtocombinethetracopt.ticket.commit_updaterwiththetestingworkflow here], as the old hook will not work with anything else than the default repository and even for this case, it won\'t trigger the appropriate notifications.\n\n===== Authz permission checking\n\nThe authz permission checking has been migrated to a fine-grained permission policy. If you use authz permissions (aka `[trac] authz_file` and `authz_module_name`), you must add `AuthzSourcePolicy` in front of your permission policies in `[trac] permission_policies`. You must also remove `BROWSER_VIEW`, `CHANGESET_VIEW`, `FILE_VIEW` and `LOG_VIEW` from your global permissions with `trac-admin $ENV permission remove` or the \"Permissions\" admin panel.\n\n===== Microsecond timestamps\n\nAll timestamps in database tables, except the `session` table, have been changed from \"seconds since epoch\" to \"microseconds since epoch\" values. This change should be transparent to most users, except for custom reports. If any of your reports use date/time columns in calculations (e.g. to pass them to `datetime()`), you must divide the values retrieved from the database by 1\'000\'000. Similarly, if a report provides a calculated value to be displayed as a date/time (i.e. with a column named \"time\", \"datetime\", \"changetime\", \"date\", \"created\" or \"modified\"), you must provide a microsecond timestamp, that is, multiply your previous calculation with 1\'000\'000.\n\n==== Upgrading from Trac 0.10 to Trac 0.11\n\n===== Site Templates and Styles\n\nThe templating engine has changed in 0.11 to Genshi, please look at TracInterfaceCustomization for more information.\n\nIf you are using custom CSS or modified templates in the `templates` directory of the TracEnvironment, you will need to convert them to the Genshi way of doing things. To continue to use your style sheet, follow the instructions at TracInterfaceCustomization#SiteAppearance.\n\n===== Trac Macros, Plugins\n\nThe Trac macros will need to be adapted, as the old-style wiki-macros are not supported anymore due to the drop of [trac:ClearSilver] and the HDF. They need to be converted to the new-style macros, see WikiMacros. When they are converted to the new style, they need to be placed into the plugins directory instead and not wiki-macros, which is no longer scanned for macros or plugins.\n\n===== For FCGI/WSGI/CGI users\n\nFor those who run Trac under the CGI environment, run this command in order to obtain the trac.*gi file:\n{{{#!sh\ntrac-admin /path/to/env deploy /deploy/directory/path\n}}}\n\nThis will create a deploy directory with the following two subdirectories: `cgi-bin` and `htdocs`. Then update your Apache configuration file `httpd.conf` with this new `trac.cgi` location and `htdocs` location.\n\n===== Web Admin plugin integrated\nIf you had the [trac:WebAdmin] plugin installed, you can uninstall it as it is part of the Trac code base since 0.11.\n\n===== New Default Configurable Workflow\n\nWhen you run `trac-admin <env> upgrade`, your `trac.ini` will be modified to include a `[ticket-workflow]` section. The workflow configured in this case is the original workflow, so that ticket actions will behave like they did in 0.10:\n\n{{{#!Workflow width=500 height=240\nleave = * -> *\nleave.operations = leave_status\nleave.default = 1\naccept = new -> assigned\naccept.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\naccept.operations = set_owner_to_self\nresolve = new,assigned,reopened -> closed\nresolve.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\nresolve.operations = set_resolution\nreassign = new,assigned,reopened -> new\nreassign.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\nreassign.operations = set_owner\nreopen = closed -> reopened\nreopen.permissions = TICKET_CREATE\nreopen.operations = del_resolution\n}}}\n\nThere are some significant caveats in this, such as accepting a ticket sets it to \'assigned\' state, and assigning a ticket sets it to \'new\' state. So you will probably want to migrate to \"basic\" workflow; [trac:source:trunk/contrib/workflow/migrate_original_to_basic.py contrib/workflow/migrate_original_to_basic.py] may be helpful. See TracWorkflow for a detailed description of the new basic workflow.\n\n===== Global Configuration\nIn versions prior to 0.11, the global configuration was by default located in `$prefix/share/trac/conf/trac.ini` or `/etc/trac/trac.ini`, depending on the distribution. You may want to specify that file to inherit from when upgrading.  Literally, when upgrading you have to add an `[inherit]` section to your project\'s `trac.ini` file. Additionally, you have to move your customized templates and common images from `$prefix/share/trac/...` to the new location.\n\n=== 7. Restart the Web Server #RestarttheWebServer\n\nIf you are not running [wiki:TracCgi CGI], reload the new Trac code by restarting your web server.\n\n== Known Issues\n\n=== Customized Templates\n\nTrac supports customization of its Genshi templates by placing copies of the templates in the `<env>/templates` folder of your [TracEnvironment environment] or in a common location specified in the [[TracIni#GlobalConfiguration| [inherit] templates_dir]] configuration setting. If you choose to do so, be aware that you will need to repeat your changes manually on a copy of the new templates when you upgrade to a new release of Trac (even a minor one), as the templates will likely evolve. So keep a diff around.\n\nThe preferred way to perform TracInterfaceCustomization is to write a custom plugin doing an appropriate `ITemplateStreamFilter` transformation, as this is more robust in case of changes: we usually won\'t modify element `id`s or change CSS `class`es, and if we have to do so, this will be documented in the [trac:TracDev/ApiChanges] pages.\n\n=== !ZipImportError\n\nDue to internal caching of zipped packages, whenever the content of the packages change on disk, the in-memory zip index will no longer match and you\'ll get irrecoverable !ZipImportError errors. Better anticipate and bring your server down for maintenance before upgrading.\nSee [trac:#7014] for details.\n\n=== Wiki Upgrade\n`trac-admin` will not delete or remove default wiki pages that were present in a previous version but are no longer in the new version.\n\n=== Trac database upgrade\n\nA known issue in some versions of [trac:PySqlite] (2.5.2-2.5.4) prevents the trac-admin upgrade script from successfully upgrading the database format. It is advised to use either a newer or older version of the sqlite python bindings to avoid this error. For more details see ticket [trac:#9434].\n\n=== Parent dir\nIf you use a Trac parent env configuration and one of the plugins in one child does not work, none of the children will work.\n\n== Related topics\n\n=== Upgrading Python\n\nUpgrading Python to a newer version will require reinstallation of Python packages: Trac itself of course, but also [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools easy_install], if you\'ve been using that. If you are using Subversion, you\'ll also need to upgrade the Python bindings for svn.\n\n==== Windows and Python 2.6\n\nIf you\'ve been using !CollabNet\'s Subversion package, you may need to uninstall that in favor of [http://alagazam.net/ Alagazam], which has the Python bindings readily available, see [trac:TracSubversion]. That package works without tweaking.\n\n=== Changing Database Backend\n\nThe [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TracMigratePlugin TracMigratePlugin] on [https://trac-hacks.org trac-hacks.org] has been written to assist in migrating between SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.\n\n=== Upgrading from older versions of Trac #OlderVersions\n\nFor upgrades from versions older than Trac 0.10, refer first to [trac:wiki:0.10/TracUpgrade#SpecificVersions].\n\n-----\nSee also: TracGuide, TracInstall',NULL,NULL),('TracWiki',1,1629200947770458,'trac','127.0.0.1','= The Trac Wiki System =\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nTrac has a built-in wiki system which you can use for organizing knowledge and information in a very flexible way by [WikiNewPage creating pages] containing an intuitive and easy to learn textual markup. The wiki markup is used throughout Trac, so not only in [wiki:TitleIndex wiki pages], but also in [TracTickets ticket] description and comments, [TracChangeset version control] log messages, [TracRoadmap milestone] descriptions, [TracReports report] descriptions  and even in third-party extensions.\nIt allows for formatted text and hyperlinks in and between all Trac modules.\n\nEditing wiki text is easy, as compared to complex markup languages like HTML, using any web browser and simple [WikiFormatting formatting]. The motivation for wiki markup is that HTML, with its large collection of nestable tags, is too complicated to allow fast-paced editing, and distracts from the actual content of the pages. Note that Trac also supports [WikiHtml HTML], [WikiRestructuredText reStructuredText] and [https://txstyle.org Textile] as alternative markup formats, which can be used in parts of a page, so called wiki blocks.\n\nThe main goal of the wiki is to make editing text easy in order to \'\'encourage\'\' people to contribute to a project. Trac also provides a simple toolbar to make formatting text even easier, and supports the [http://universaleditbutton.org/Universal_Edit_Button universal edit button] of your browser.\n\nThe wiki itself does not enforce any structure, but rather resembles a stack of empty sheets of paper, where you can organize information and documentation as you see fit, and later reorganize if necessary. \nAs contributing to a wiki is essentially building hypertext, general advice regarding HTML authoring apply here as well.\nFor example, the \'\'[https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style Style Guide for online hypertext]\'\' explains how to think about the [https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/Structure.html overall structure of a work] and how to organize information [https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/WithinDocument.html within each document].

One of those may be a good match for what you want. They can be pasted into the `[ticket-workflow]` section of your `trac.ini` file. However, if you have existing tickets then there may be issues if those tickets have states that are not in the new workflow. \n\nHere are some [trac:WorkFlow/Examples diagrams] of the above examples.\n\n== Basic Ticket Workflow Customization\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': Ticket \"statuses\" or \"states\" are not separately defined. The states a ticket can be in are automatically generated by the transitions defined in a workflow. Therefore, creating a new ticket state simply requires defining a state transition in the workflow that starts or ends with that state.\n\nCreate a `[ticket-workflow]` section in `trac.ini`.\nWithin this section, each entry is an action that may be taken on a ticket. \nFor example, consider the `accept` action from `simple-workflow.ini`:\n\n{{{#!ini\naccept = new,accepted -> accepted\naccept.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\naccept.operations = set_owner_to_self\n}}}\n\nThe first line in this example defines the `accept` action, along with the states the action is valid in (`new` and `accepted`), and the new state of the ticket when the action is taken (`accepted`).\nThe `accept.permissions` line specifies what permissions the user must have to use this action.\nThe `accept.operations` line specifies changes that will be made to the ticket in addition to the status change when this action is taken.  In this case, when a user clicks on `accept`, the ticket owner field is updated to the logged in user.  Multiple operations may be specified in a comma separated list.\n\nThe available operations are:\n- **del_owner** -- Clear the owner field.\n- **set_owner** -- Sets the owner to the selected or entered owner. Defaults to the current user. When `[ticket] restrict_owner = true`, the select will be populated with users that have `TICKET_MODIFY` permission and an authenticated session.\n - \'\'actionname\'\'`.set_owner` may optionally be set to a comma delimited list of users that will be used to populate the select, or a single user.\n- **set_owner_to_self** -- Sets the owner to the logged in user.\n- **del_resolution** -- Clears the resolution field.\n- **set_resolution** -- Sets the resolution to the selected value.\n - \'\'actionname\'\'`.set_resolution` may optionally be set to a comma delimited list or a single value. Example:\n {{{#!ini\nresolve_new = new -> closed\nresolve_new.name = resolve\nresolve_new.operations = set_resolution\nresolve_new.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\nresolve_new.set_resolution = invalid,wontfix\n}}}\n- **leave_status** -- Displays \"leave as <current status>\" and makes no change to the ticket.\n- **reset_workflow** -- Resets the status of tickets that are in states no longer defined.\n\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' Specifying conflicting operations, such as `set_owner` and `del_owner`, has unspecified results.\n\nIn this example, we see the `.name` attribute used. The action here is `resolve_accepted`, but it will be presented to the user as `resolve`:\n\n{{{#!ini\nresolve_accepted = accepted -> closed\nresolve_accepted.name = resolve\nresolve_accepted.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\nresolve_accepted.operations = set_resolution\n}}}\n\nFor actions that should be available in all states, `*` may be used in place of the state. The obvious example is the `leave` action:\n{{{#!ini\nleave = * -> *\nleave.operations = leave_status\nleave.default = 1\n}}}\n\nThis also shows the use of the `.default` attribute. This value is expected to be an integer, and the order in which the actions are displayed is determined by this value. The action with the highest `.default` value is listed first, and is selected by default. The rest of the actions are listed in order of decreasing `.default` values.\nIf not specified for an action, `.default` is 0. The value may be negative.\n\nThere are a couple of hard-coded constraints to the workflow. In particular, tickets are created with status `new`, and tickets are expected to have a `closed` state. Further, the default reports/queries treat any state other than `closed` as an open state.\n\nThe special `_reset` action is added by default for tickets that are in states that are no longer defined. This allows tickets to be individually \"repaired\" after the workflow is changed, although it\'s recommended that the administrator perform the action by batch modifying the affected tickets. By default the `_reset` action is available to users with the `TICKET_ADMIN` permission and reset tickets are put in the //new// state. The default `_reset` action is equivalent to the following `[ticket-workflow]` action definition:\n\n{{{#!ini\n_reset = -> new\n_reset.name = reset\n_reset.operations = reset_workflow\n_reset.permissions = TICKET_ADMIN\n_reset.default = 0\n}}}\n\nSince [trac:milestone:1.0.3] the `_reset` action can be customized by redefining the implicit action. For example, to allow anyone with `TICKET_MODIFY` to perform the `_reset` action, the workflow action would need to be defined:\n\n{{{#!ini\n_reset = -> new\n_reset.name = reset\n_reset.operations = reset_workflow\n_reset.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\n_reset.default = 0\n}}}\n\n== Workflow Visualization\n\nWorkflows can be visualized by rendering them on the wiki using the [WikiMacros#Workflow-macro Workflow macro].\n\nWorkflows can also be visualized using the `contrib/workflow/workflow_parser.py` script. The script outputs `.dot` files that [http://www.graphviz.org GraphViz] understands. The script can be used as follows (your install path may be different):\n\n{{{#!sh\ncd /var/local/trac_devel/contrib/workflow/\nsudo ./showworkflow /srv/trac/PlannerSuite/conf/trac.ini\n}}}\nAnd then open up the resulting `trac.pdf` file created by the script. It will be in the same directory as the `trac.ini` file.\n\nAfter you have changed a workflow, you need to restart your webserver for the changes to take effect.\n\n== Example: Adding optional Testing with Workflow\n\nBy adding the following to your [ticket-workflow] section of trac.ini you get optional testing. When the ticket has status `new`, `accepted` or `needs_work`, you can choose to submit it for testing.  When it\'s in the testing status the user gets the option to reject it and send it back to `needs_work`, or pass the testing and send it along to `closed`. If they accept it, then it is automatically marked as `closed` and the resolution is set to `fixed`. Since all the old work flow remains, a ticket can skip this entire section.\n\n{{{#!ini\ntesting = new,accepted,needs_work,assigned,reopened -> testing\ntesting.name = Submit to reporter for testing\ntesting.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\n\nreject = testing -> needs_work\nreject.name = Failed testing, return to developer\n\npass = testing -> closed\npass.name = Passes Testing\npass.operations = set_resolution\npass.set_resolution = fixed\n}}}\n\n=== How to combine the `tracopt.ticket.commit_updater` with the testing workflow\n\nThe [[trac:source:trunk/tracopt/ticket/commit_updater.py|tracopt.ticket.commit_updater]] is the optional component that [[TracRepositoryAdmin#trac-post-commit-hook|replaces the old trac-post-commit-hook]], in Trac 0.12.\n\nBy default it reacts on some keywords found in changeset message logs like \'\'close\'\', \'\'fix\'\' etc. and performs the corresponding workflow action.\n\nIf you have a more complex workflow, like the testing stage described above and you want the \'\'closes\'\' keyword to move the ticket to the \'\'testing\'\' status instead of the \'\'closed\'\' status, you need to adapt the code a bit. \n\nHave a look at the [[trac:wiki:0.11/TracWorkflow#How-ToCombineSVNtrac-post-commit-hookWithTestWorkflow|Trac 0.11 recipe]] for the `trac-post-commit-hook`, this will give you some ideas about how to modify the component.\n\n== Example: Add simple optional generic review state\n\nSometimes Trac is used in situations where \"testing\" can mean different things to different people so you may want to create an optional workflow state that is between the default workflow\'s `assigned` and `closed` states, but does not impose implementation-specific details. The only new state you need to add for this is a `reviewing` state. A ticket may then be \"submitted for review\" from any state that it can be reassigned. If a review passes, you can re-use the `resolve` action to close the ticket, and if it fails you can re-use the `reassign` action to push it back into the normal workflow.\n\nThe new `reviewing` state along with its associated `review` action looks like this:\n\n{{{#!ini\nreview = new,assigned,reopened -> reviewing\nreview.operations = set_owner\nreview.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\n}}}\n\nThen, to integrate this with the default Trac 0.11 workflow, you also need to add the `reviewing` state to the `accept` and `resolve` actions:\n\n{{{#!ini\naccept = new,reviewing -> assigned\n[…]\nresolve = new,assigned,reopened,reviewing -> closed\n}}}\n\nOptionally, you can also add a new action that allows you to change the ticket\'s owner without moving the ticket out of the `reviewing` state. This enables you to reassign review work without pushing the ticket back to the `new` status:\n\n{{{#!ini\nreassign_reviewing = reviewing -> *\nreassign_reviewing.name = reassign review\nreassign_reviewing.operations = set_owner\nreassign_reviewing.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\n}}}\n\nThe full `[ticket-workflow]` configuration will thus look like this:\n\n{{{#!ini\n[ticket-workflow]\naccept = new,reviewing -> assigned\naccept.operations = set_owner_to_self\naccept.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\nleave = * -> *\nleave.default = 1\nleave.operations = leave_status\nreassign = new,assigned,accepted,reopened -> assigned\nreassign.operations = set_owner\nreassign.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\nreopen = closed -> reopened\nreopen.operations = del_resolution\nreopen.permissions = TICKET_CREATE\nresolve = new,assigned,reopened,reviewing -> closed\nresolve.operations = set_resolution\nresolve.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\nreview = new,assigned,reopened -> reviewing\nreview.operations = set_owner\nreview.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\nreassign_reviewing = reviewing -> *\nreassign_reviewing.operations = set_owner\nreassign_reviewing.name = reassign review\nreassign_reviewing.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\n}}}\n\n== Example: Limit the resolution options for a new ticket\n\nThe above `resolve_new` operation allows you to set the possible resolutions for a new ticket. By modifying the existing resolve action and removing the new status from before the `->` we then get two resolve actions. One with limited resolutions for new tickets, and then the regular one once a ticket is accepted.\n\n{{{#!ini\nresolve_new = new -> closed\nresolve_new.name = resolve\nresolve_new.operations = set_resolution\nresolve_new.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\nresolve_new.set_resolution = invalid,wontfix,duplicate\n\nresolve = assigned,accepted,reopened -> closed\nresolve.operations = set_resolution\nresolve.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY\n}}}\n\n== Advanced Ticket Workflow Customization\n\nIf the customizations above do not meet your needs, you can extend the workflow with plugins. Plugins can provide additional operations for the workflow, like code_review, or implement side-effects for an action, such as triggering a build, that may not be merely simple state changes. Look at [trac:source:trunk/sample-plugins/workflow sample-plugins/workflow] for a few examples to get started.\n\nBut if even that is not enough, you can disable the !ConfigurableTicketWorkflow component and create a plugin that completely replaces it.\n\n== Adding Workflow States to Milestone Progress Bars\n\nIf you add additional states to your workflow, you may want to customize your milestone progress bars as well. See [TracIni#milestone-groups-section TracIni].\n\n== Ideas for next steps\n\nNew enhancement ideas for the workflow system should be filed as enhancement tickets against the `ticket system` component.  You can also document ideas on the [trac:TracIdeas/TracWorkflow TracIdeas/TracWorkflow] page. Also look at the [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AdvancedTicketWorkflowPlugin AdvancedTicketWorkflowPlugin] as it provides experimental operations.\n\nSome of the ideas described here are originally proposed in [trac:NewWorkflow].',NULL,NULL),('WikiDeletePage',1,1629200947710713,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Deleting a Wiki Page =\n\nWiki pages can be completely deleted using the //Delete page// or the //Delete this version// button at the bottom of the wiki page.

Example:\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  ||=Text =||= Numbers =||\n  ||left align    ||        1.0||\n  ||  center      ||        4.5||\n  ||      right align||     4.5||\n  || default alignment ||   2.5||\n  ||default||         2.5||\n  ||  default ||      2.5||\n  || default ||       2.5||\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td style=\"padding: 2em;\"\n||=Text =||= Numbers =||\n||left align    ||        1.0||\n||  center      ||        4.5||\n||      right align||     4.5||\n|| default alignment ||   2.5||\n||default||         2.5||\n||  default ||      2.5||\n|| default ||       2.5||\n}}}\n\nIf contrary to the example above, the cells in your table contain more text, it might be convenient to spread a table row over multiple lines of markup. The `\\` character placed at the end of a line after a cell separator tells Trac to not start a new row for the cells on the next line.\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  || this is column 1 [http://trac.edgewall.org/newticket new ticket] || \\\n  || this is column 2 [http://trac.edgewall.org/roadmap the road ahead] || \\\n  || that\'s column 3 and last one ||\n  }}}\n}}}\n|-------------\n||= Display =||\n{{{#!td style=\"padding: 2em;\"\n|| this is column 1 [http://trac.edgewall.org/newticket new ticket] || \\\n|| this is column 2 [http://trac.edgewall.org/roadmap the road ahead] || \\\n|| that\'s column 3 and last one ||\n}}}\n\n=== Complex Tables\n\nIf the possibilities offered by the simple pipe-based markup (\'||\') for tables described above are not enough for your needs, you can create more elaborate tables by using [#Processors-example-tables WikiProcessor based tables].\n\n== Links\n\nHyperlinks are automatically created for WikiPageNames and URLs. !WikiPageLinks can be disabled by prepending an exclamation mark (\'!\'), such as {{{!WikiPageLink}}}.\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  TitleIndex, http://www.edgewall.com/, !NotAlink\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\nTitleIndex, http://www.edgewall.com/, !NotAlink\n}}}\n\nLinks can be given a more descriptive title by writing the link followed by a space and a title and all this inside square brackets. \nIf the descriptive title is omitted, then the explicit prefix is discarded, unless the link is an external link. This can be useful for wiki pages not adhering to the WikiPageNames convention.\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n   * [http://www.edgewall.com Edgewall Software]\n   * [wiki:TitleIndex Title Index] \n   * [wiki:TitleIndex] \n   * [wiki:ISO9000]\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n   * [http://www.edgewall.com Edgewall Software]\n   * [wiki:TitleIndex Title Index] \n   * [wiki:TitleIndex] \n   * [wiki:ISO9000]\n}}}\n\nFollowing the [trac:WikiCreole] trend, the descriptive title can also be specified by writing the link followed by a pipe (\'|\') and a title and all this inside //double// square brackets. \n\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n   * [[http://www.edgewall.com|Edgewall Software]]\n   * [[wiki:TitleIndex|Title Index]]\n     or even [[TitleIndex|Title Index]]\n   * [[wiki:TitleIndex]]\n     \'\'\' but not ![[TitleIndex]]! \'\'\'\n   * [[ISO9000]]\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n   * [[http://www.edgewall.com|Edgewall Software]]\n   * [[wiki:TitleIndex|Title Index]]\n     or even [[TitleIndex|Title Index]]\n   * [[wiki:TitleIndex]]\n     \'\'\' but not ![[TitleIndex]]! \'\'\'\n   * [[ISO9000]]\n}}}\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': the [trac:WikiCreole] style for links is quick to type and certainly looks familiar as it is the one used on Wikipedia and in many other wikis. Unfortunately it conflicts with the syntax for [#Macros macros].\nSo in the rare case when you need to refer to a page which is named after a macro (typical examples being TitleIndex, InterTrac and InterWiki), by writing `[[TitleIndex]]` you will actually call the macro instead of linking to the page.\n\n== Trac Links\n\nWiki pages can link directly to other parts of the Trac system. Pages can refer to tickets, reports, changesets, milestones, source files and other Wiki pages using the following notations:\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n   * Tickets: #1 or ticket:1\n   * Reports: {1} or report:1\n   * Changesets: r1, [1] or changeset:1\n   * ...\n   * targeting other Trac instances, \n     so called InterTrac links:\n     - Tickets: #Trac1 or Trac:ticket:1\n     - Changesets: [Trac1] or Trac:changeset:1\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n * Tickets: #1 or ticket:1\n * Reports: {1} or report:1\n * Changesets: r1, [1] or changeset:1\n * ... \n * targeting other Trac instances, \n   so called InterTrac links:\n   - Tickets: #Trac1 or Trac:ticket:1\n   - Changesets: [Trac1] or Trac:changeset:1\n}}}\n\nThere are many more flavors of Trac links, see TracLinks for more in-depth information and a reference for all the default link resolvers.\n\n== Setting Anchors\n\nAn anchor, or more correctly speaking, an [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.2.1 anchor name] can be added explicitly at any place in the Wiki page, in order to uniquely identify a position in the document:\n\n{{{\n[=#point1]\n}}}\n\nThis syntax was chosen to match the format for explicitly naming the header id [#Headings documented above]. For example:\n{{{\n== Long title == #title\n}}}\n\nIt is also very close to the syntax for the corresponding link to that anchor:\n{{{\n[#point1]\n}}}\n\nOptionally, a label can be given to the anchor:\n{{{\n[[=#point1 \'\'\'Point 1\'\'\']]\n}}}\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n|----------------------------------\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  [#point2 jump to the second point]\n\n  ...\n\n  Point2:  [=#point2] Jump here\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n  [#point2 jump to the second point]\n\n  ...\n\n  Point2:  [=#point2] Jump here\n}}}\n\nFor more complex anchors (eg when a custom title is wanted), you can use the Span macro: `[[span(id=point2, class=wikianchor, title=Point 2, ^(2)^)]]`.\n\n== Escaping Links, WikiPageNames and other Markup == #Escaping\n\nYou may avoid making hyperlinks out of TracLinks by preceding an expression with a single exclamation mark (\'!\').\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n   !NoHyperLink\n   !#42 is not a link\n  }}}\n  {{{\nVarious forms of escaping for list markup:\n ^^- escaped minus sign \\\\\n ^^1. escaped number  \\\\\n ^^* escaped asterisk sign\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n !NoHyperLink\n !#42 is not a link\n\nVarious forms of escaping for list markup:\n ^^- escaped minus sign \\\\\n ^^1. escaped number  \\\\\n ^^* escaped asterisk sign\n}}}\n\n== Images\n\nUrls ending with `.png`, `.gif` or `.jpg` are no longer automatically interpreted as image links, and converted to `<img>` tags.\n\nYou now have to use the ![[Image]] macro. The simplest way to include an image is to upload it as attachment to the current page, and put the filename in a macro call like `[[Image(picture.gif)]]`.\n\nIn addition to the current page, it is possible to refer to other resources:\n * `[[Image(wiki:WikiFormatting:picture.gif)]]` (referring to attachment on another page)\n * `[[Image(ticket:1:picture.gif)]]` (file attached to a ticket)\n * `[[Image(htdocs:picture.gif)]]` (referring to a file inside the [TracEnvironment environment] `htdocs` directory)\n * `[[Image(source:/trunk/trac/htdocs/trac_logo_mini.png)]]` (a file in repository)\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  [[Image(htdocs:../common/trac_logo_mini.png)]]\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n[[Image(htdocs:../common/trac_logo_mini.png)]]\n}}}\n\nSee WikiMacros for further documentation on the `[[Image()]]` macro, which has several useful options (`title=`, `link=`, etc.)\n\n== Macros\n\nMacros are \'\'custom functions\'\' to insert dynamic content in a page.\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  [[RecentChanges(Trac,3)]]\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td style=\"padding-left: 2em\"\n[[RecentChanges(Trac,3)]]\n}}}\n\nSee WikiMacros for more information, and a list of installed macros.\n\nThe detailed help for a specific macro can also be obtained more directly by appending a \"?\" to the macro name.\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  [[MacroList?]]\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td style=\"padding-left: 2em\"\n[[MacroList?]]\n}}}\n\n== Processors\n\nTrac supports alternative markup formats using WikiProcessors.

Those Wiki processors are built-in and do not require additional packages to be installed.\n\n== How to use `#!html` == #HowtoUseHTML\nTo inform the wiki engine that a block of text should be treated as HTML, use the \'\'html\'\' processor:\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!html\n  <h1 style=\"text-align: right; color: blue\">HTML Test</h1>\n  }}}\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td style=\"padding-left: 2em\"\n  {{{\n  #!html\n  <h1 style=\"text-align: right; color: blue\">HTML Test</h1>\n  }}}\n}}}\n\nNote that Trac sanitizes your HTML code before displaying it. That means that potentially dangerous constructs, such as Javascript event handlers, will be removed from the output. \n\nThe filtering is done by [http://genshi.edgewall.org/ Genshi] and the output will be a well-formed fragment of HTML. This means that you can no longer use two HTML blocks, one for opening a <div> and another for closing it, in order to wrap arbitrary wiki text.\nThe new way to wrap any wiki content inside a <div> is to use the `#!div` Wiki processor.\n\n== How to use `#!div` and `#!span` == #HowtoUseDivSpan\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!div class=\"important\" \n  **important** is a predefined class.\n  }}}\n  }}}\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!div style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n  **wikipage** is another predefined class that will \n  be used when no class is specified.\n  }}}\n  }}}\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!div class=\"compact\" style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n  **compact** is another predefined class reducing\n  the padding within the `<div>` to a minimum.\n  }}}\n  }}}\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!div class=\"wikipage compact\" style=\"border: 1pt dotted\"\n  Classes can be combined (here **wikipage** and **compact**)\n  which results in this case in reduced //vertical// \n  padding but there\'s still some horizontal space for coping\n  with headings.\n  }}}\n  }}}\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!div class=\"\" style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n  Explicitly specifying no classes is //not// the same\n  as specifying no class attribute, as this will remove\n  the //wikipage// default class.\n  }}}\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td style=\"padding-left: 2em\"\n\n  {{{\n  #!div class=\"important\" \n  **important** is a predefined class.\n  }}}\n\n  {{{\n  #!div style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n  **wikipage** is another predefined class that will \n  be used when no class is specified.\n  }}}\n\n  {{{\n  #!div class=\"compact\" style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n  **compact** is another predefined class reducing\n  the padding within the `<div>` to a minimum.\n  }}}\n\n  {{{\n  #!div class=\"wikipage compact\" style=\"border: 1pt dotted\"\n  Classes can be combined (here **wikipage** and **compact**)\n  which results in this case in reduced //vertical// \n  padding but there\'s still some horizontal space for coping\n  with headings.\n  }}}\n\n  {{{\n  #!div class=\"\" style=\"border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em\"\n  Explicitly specifying no classes is //not// the same\n  as specifying no class attribute, as this will remove\n  the //wikipage// default class.\n  }}}\n\n}}}\n\nNote that the contents of a `#!div` block are contained in one or more paragraphs, which have a non-zero top and bottom margin. This leads to the top and bottom padding in the example above. To remove the top and bottom margin of the content, add the `compact` class to the `#!div`. Another predefined class besides `wikipage` and `compact` is `important`, which can be used to make a paragraph stand out. Extra CSS classes can be defined via the `site/style.css` file for example, see TracInterfaceCustomization#SiteAppearance.\n\nFor spans, you should use the Macro call syntax:\n||= Wiki Markup =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  Hello \n  [[span(\'\'WORLD\'\' (click [#anchor here]), style=color: green; font-size: 120%, id=anchor)]]!\n  }}}\n}}}\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n||= Display =||\n{{{#!td style=\"padding-left: 2em\"\n  Hello\n  [[span(\'\'WORLD\'\' (click [#anchor here]), style=color: green; font-size: 120%, id=anchor)]]!\n}}}\n\n== How to use `#!td` and other table related processors == #Tables\n\nThe `#!td` or `#!th` processors should be used to create table data and table header cells, respectively. The other processors `#!table` and `#!tr` are not required for introducing a table structure, as `#!td` and `#!th` will do this automatically. The `|-` row separator can be used to start a new row when needed, but some may prefer to use a `#!tr` block for that, as this introduces a more formal grouping and offers the possibility to use an extra level of indentation.

By removing this class (`#!table class=\"\"`), one regains complete control on the table presentation.

Macros are a special type of plugin and are written in Python. A macro inserts dynamic HTML data in any context supporting WikiFormatting.\n\nThe macro syntax is `[[macro-name(optional-arguments)]]`.\n\n\'\'\'WikiProcessors\'\'\' are another kind of macros. They are typically used for source code highlighting, such as `!#python` or `!#apache` and when the source code spans multiple lines, such as:\n\n{{{\n{{{#!wiki-processor-name\n... \n}}}\n}}}\n\n== Using Macros\n\nMacro calls are enclosed in double-square brackets `[[..]]`. Like Python functions, macros can have arguments, which is then a comma separated list within parentheses `[[..(,)]]`.\n\n=== Getting Detailed Help\n\nThe list of available macros and the full help can be obtained using the !MacroList macro, as seen [#AvailableMacros below].\n\nA brief list can be obtained via `[[MacroList(*)]]` or `[[?]]`.\n\nDetailed help on a specific macro can be obtained by passing it as an argument to !MacroList, e.g. `[[MacroList(MacroList)]]`, or, more conveniently, by appending a question mark (`?`) to the macro\'s name, like in `[[MacroList?]]`.\n\n=== Example\n\nA list of the 3 most recently changed wiki pages starting with \'Trac\':\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  [[RecentChanges(Trac,3)]]\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"\n[[RecentChanges(Trac,3)]]\n}}}\n|-----------------------------------\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  [[RecentChanges?(Trac,3)]]\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"\n[[RecentChanges?(Trac,3)]]\n}}}\n|-----------------------------------\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  [[?]]\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td style=\"padding-left: 2em\"\n{{{#!html \n<div class=\"trac-macrolist\">\n<h3><code>[[Image]]</code></h3>Embed an image in wiki-formatted text.\n\nThe first argument is the file, as in <code>[[Image(filename.png)]]</code>\n<h3><code>[[InterTrac]]</code></h3>Provide a list of known <a class=\"wiki\" href=\"/wiki/InterTrac\">InterTrac</a> prefixes.\n<h3><code>[[InterWiki]]</code></h3>Provide a description list for the known <a class=\"wiki\" href=\"/wiki/InterWiki\">InterWiki</a> prefixes.\n<h3><code>[[KnownMimeTypes]]</code></h3>List all known mime-types which can be used as <a class=\"wiki\" href=\"/wiki/WikiProcessors\">WikiProcessors</a>.\n</div>\n}}}\netc.\n}}}\n\n== Available Macros\n\n\'\'Note that the following list will only contain the macro documentation if you\'ve not enabled `-OO` optimizations, or not set the `PythonOptimize` option for [wiki:TracModPython mod_python].\'\'\n\n[[MacroList]]\n\n== Macros from around the world\n\nThe [http://trac-hacks.org/ Trac Hacks] site provides a wide collection of macros and other Trac [TracPlugins plugins] contributed by the Trac community. If you are looking for new macros, or have written one that you would like to share, please visit that site.\n\n== Developing Custom Macros\n\nMacros, like Trac itself, are written in the [http://python.org/ Python programming language] and are developed as part of TracPlugins.\n\nFor more information about developing macros, see the [trac:TracDev development resources] on the main project site.\n\nHere are 2 simple examples showing how to create a Macro. Also, have a look at [trac:source:tags/trac-1.0.2/sample-plugins/Timestamp.py Timestamp.py] for an example that shows the difference between old style and new style macros and at the [trac:source:tags/trac-0.11/wiki-macros/README macros/README] which provides more insight about the transition.\n\n=== Macro without arguments\n\nTo test the following code, save it in a `timestamp_sample.py` file located in the TracEnvironment\'s `plugins/` directory.\n\n{{{#!python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n# Note: since Trac 0.11, datetime objects are used internally\n\nfrom genshi.builder import tag\n\nfrom trac.util.datefmt import format_datetime, utc\nfrom trac.wiki.macros import WikiMacroBase\n\nclass TimeStampMacro(WikiMacroBase):\n    \"\"\"Inserts the current time (in seconds) into the wiki page.\"\"\"\n\n    revision = \"$Rev$\"\n    url = \"$URL$\"\n\n    def expand_macro(self, formatter, name, text):\n        t = datetime.now(utc)\n        return tag.strong(format_datetime(t, \'%c\'))\n}}}\n\n=== Macro with arguments\n\nTo test the following code, save it in a `helloworld_sample.py` file located in the TracEnvironment\'s `plugins/` directory.\n\n{{{#!python\nfrom genshi.core import Markup\n\nfrom trac.wiki.macros import WikiMacroBase\n\nclass HelloWorldMacro(WikiMacroBase):\n    \"\"\"Simple HelloWorld macro.\n\n    Note that the name of the class is meaningful:\n     - it must end with \"Macro\"\n     - what comes before \"Macro\" ends up being the macro name\n\n    The documentation of the class (i.e. what you\'re reading)\n    will become the documentation of the macro, as shown by\n    the !MacroList macro (usually used in the WikiMacros page).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    revision = \"$Rev$\"\n    url = \"$URL$\"\n\n    def expand_macro(self, formatter, name, text, args):\n        \"\"\"Return some output that will be displayed in the Wiki content.\n\n        `name` is the actual name of the macro (no surprise, here it\'ll be\n        `\'HelloWorld\'`),\n        `text` is the text enclosed in parenthesis at the call of the macro.\n          Note that if there are \'\'no\'\' parenthesis (like in, e.g.\n          [[HelloWorld]]), then `text` is `None`.\n        `args` are the arguments passed when HelloWorld is called using a\n        `#!HelloWorld` code block.\n        \"\"\"\n        return \'Hello World, text = %s, args = %s\' % \\\n            (Markup.escape(text), Markup.escape(repr(args)))\n\n}}}\n\nNote that `expand_macro` optionally takes a 4^th^ parameter \'\'`args`\'\'. When the macro is called as a [WikiProcessors WikiProcessor], it is also possible to pass `key=value` [WikiProcessors#UsingProcessors processor parameters]. If given, those are stored in a dictionary and passed in this extra `args` parameter. In the other case, when called as a macro, `args` is `None`. (\'\'since 0.12\'\').\n\nFor example, when writing:\n{{{\n{{{#!HelloWorld style=\"polite\" -silent verbose\n<Hello World!>\n}}}\n\n{{{#!HelloWorld\n<Hello World!>\n}}}\n\n[[HelloWorld(<Hello World!>)]]\n}}}\n\nOne should get:\n{{{\nHello World, text = <Hello World!>, args = {\'style\': u\'polite\', \'silent\': False, \'verbose\': True}\nHello World, text = <Hello World!>, args = {}\nHello World, text = <Hello World!>, args = None\n}}}\n\nNote that the return value of `expand_macro` is \'\'\'not\'\'\' HTML escaped. Depending on the expected result, you should escape it yourself (using `return Markup.escape(result)`) or, if this is indeed HTML, wrap it in a Markup object (`return Markup(result)`) with `Markup` coming from Genshi (`from genshi.core import Markup`).\n\nYou can also recursively use a wiki Formatter (`from trac.wiki import Formatter`) to process the `text` as wiki markup:\n\n{{{#!python\nfrom genshi.core import Markup\nfrom trac.wiki.macros import WikiMacroBase\nfrom trac.wiki import Formatter\nimport StringIO\n\nclass HelloWorldMacro(WikiMacroBase):\n    def expand_macro(self, formatter, name, text, args):\n        text = \"whatever \'\'\'wiki\'\'\' markup you want, even containing other macros\"\n        # Convert Wiki markup to HTML, new style\n        out = StringIO.StringIO()\n        Formatter(self.env, formatter.context).format(text, out)\n        return Markup(out.getvalue())\n}}}',NULL,NULL),('WikiNewPage',1,1629200947708428,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Steps to Add a New Wiki Page =\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nYou can create a new wiki page by typing the CamelCase name of the page in the quick-search field at the top of the page, or by trying to view a wiki page of that name, ie by visiting for example http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MyNewWikiPage. Note that a page is \"orphaned\" by default until it is linked to from another page. \n\nPrerequisite: make sure you actually have the rights to edit wiki pages. If you don\'t see the **Edit this page** button near the bottom of the page, read the information relative to the editing policy for your Trac installation, usually on the front page WikiStart, or contact your local Trac administrator.\n\nA new wiki page can also be created as follows:\n\n 1. Choose a name for your new page. See WikiPageNames for naming conventions.\n 2. Edit an existing page or any other resource that support WikiFormatting and add a [TracLinks link] to your new page. Save your changes.\n 3. Follow the link you created to take you to the new page. Trac will display a \"describe !PageName here\" message.\n 4. Click the \"Edit this page\" button to edit and add content to your new page. Save your changes and your new page is published.\n\n== Rename a page #renaming\n\nWhile creating good WikiPageNames is important for usability purposes, you can always rename the page later. You will need the WIKI_RENAME permission to rename pages.\n\nWhen renaming a page, you\'ll be offered the possibility to create a redirection page, so that links pointing to the old location will not be pointing to a non-existent page.\n\n----\nSee also: TracWiki, PageTemplates, WikiFormatting, TracLinks, WikiDeletePage\n',NULL,NULL),('WikiPageNames',1,1629200947640220,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Wiki Page Names\n[[TracGuideToc]]\n\nWiki page names commonly use the CamelCase convention. Within wiki text, any word in CamelCase automatically becomes a hyperlink to the wiki page with that name.\n\nCamelCase page names follow these rules:\n\n 1. The name must consist of \'\'\'alphabetic characters only\'\'\'; no digits, spaces, punctuation or underscores are allowed.\n 1. A name must have at least two capital letters.\n 1. The first character must be capitalized.\n 1. Every capital letter must be followed by one or more lower-case letters. \n 1. The use of slash ( / ) is permitted in page names, where it typically represents a hierarchy.\n\nIf you want to create a wiki page that does not follow CamelCase rules. you can use the following syntax:\n{{{\n * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:ISO9000],\n   and with a label: [wiki:ISO9000 ISO 9000 standard]\n * [wiki:\"Space Matters\"]\n   and with a label: [wiki:\"Space Matters\" all about white space]\n * or simply: [\"WikiPageName\"]s\n * even better, the new [[WikiCreole link style]]\n   and with a label: [[WikiCreole link style|WikiCreole style links]]\n}}}\n\nThis will be rendered as:\n * [wiki:Wiki_page], [wiki:ISO9000],\n   and with a label: [wiki:ISO9000 ISO 9000 standard]\n * [wiki:\"Space Matters\"] \'\'(that page name embeds space characters)\'\'\n   and with a label: [wiki:\"Space Matters\" all about white space]\n * or simply: [\"WikiPageName\"]s\n * even better, the new [[WikiCreole link style]]\n   and with a label: [[WikiCreole link style|WikiCreole style links]]\n\nIt is possible to link to a specific \'\'version\'\' of a Wiki page as you would do for a specific version of a file, for example: WikiStart@1.\n\nYou can also prevent a !CamelCase name from being interpreted as a [TracLinks link] by quoting it with an exclamation mark: `!CamelCase`. See TracLinks#EscapingLinks.\n\nAs in the example above, you can also append an anchor to a Wiki page name to link to a specific section within that page. The anchor can be seen by hovering the mouse over a section heading, then clicking on the [[html(&para;)]] sign that appears at its end. The anchor is usually generated automatically, but it is also possible to specify it explicitly: see WikiFormatting#using-explicit-id-in-heading.\n\n----\nSee also: WikiNewPage, WikiFormatting, TracWiki, TracLinks\n',NULL,NULL),('WikiProcessors',1,1629200947570242,'trac','127.0.0.1','= Wiki Processors\n\nProcessors are WikiMacros designed to provide alternative markup formats for the [TracWiki Wiki engine]. Processors can be thought of as \'\'macro functions to process user-edited text\'\'. \n\nWiki processors can be used in any Wiki text throughout Trac, such as:\n - [#CodeHighlightingSupport syntax highlighting] or for rendering text verbatim\n - rendering [#HTMLrelated Wiki markup inside a context], like inside <div> blocks or <span> or within <td> or <th> table cells\n - using an alternative markup syntax, like [wiki:WikiHtml raw HTML] and [wiki:WikiRestructuredText Restructured Text] or [http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ textile]\n\n== Using Processors\n\nTo use a processor on a block of text, first delimit the lines using a Wiki \'\'code block\'\':\n{{{\n{{{\nThe lines\nthat should be processed...\n}}}\n}}}\n\nImmediately after the `{{{` or on the line just below, add `#!` followed by the \'\'processor name\'\':\n\n{{{\n{{{\n#!processorname\nThe lines\nthat should be processed...\n}}}\n}}}\n\nThis is the \"shebang\" notation, familiar to most UNIX users.\n\nBesides their content, some Wiki processors can also accept \'\'parameters\'\', which are then given as `key=value` pairs after the processor name and on the same line. If `value` has to contain space, as it\'s often the case for the style parameter, a quoted string can be used (`key=\"value with space\"`).\n\nAs some processors are meant to process Wiki markup, it\'s quite possible to \'\'nest\'\' processor blocks.\nYou may want to indent the content of nested blocks for increased clarity, this extra indentation will be ignored when processing the content.\n\n== Examples\n\n||= Wiki Markup =||= Display =||\n{{{#!td colspan=2 align=center style=\"border: none\"\n\n                __Example 1__: Inserting raw HTML\n}}}\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------\n{{{#!td style=\"border: none\"\n{{{\n{{{\n#!html\n<h1 style=\"color: grey\">This is raw HTML</h1>\n}}}\n}}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td valign=top style=\"border: none; padding-left: 2em\"\n{{{\n#!html\n<h1 style=\"color: grey\">This is raw HTML</h1>\n}}}\n}}}\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------\n{{{#!td colspan=2 align=center style=\"border: none\"\n\n     __Example 2__: Highlighted Python code in a <div> block with custom style\n}}}\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------\n{{{#!td style=\"border: none\"\n  {{{\n  {{{#!div style=\"background: #ffd; border: 3px ridge\"\n\n  This is an example of embedded \"code\" block:\n\n    {{{\n    #!python\n    def hello():\n        return \"world\"\n    }}}\n\n  }}}\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td valign=top style=\"border: none; padding: 1em\"\n  {{{#!div style=\"background: #ffd; border: 3px ridge\"\n\n  This is an example of embedded \"code\" block:\n\n    {{{\n    #!python\n    def hello():\n        return \"world\"\n    }}}\n\n  }}}\n}}}\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------\n{{{#!td colspan=2 align=center style=\"border: none\"\n\n     __Example 3__: Searching tickets from a wiki page, by keywords.\n}}}\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------\n{{{#!td style=\"border: none\"\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!html\n  <form action=\"/query\" method=\"get\"><div>\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"keywords\" value=\"~\" size=\"30\"/>\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Search by Keywords\"/>\n  <!-- To control what fields show up use hidden fields\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"id\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"summary\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"status\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"milestone\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"version\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"owner\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"priority\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"component\"/>\n  -->\n  </div></form>\n  }}}\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td valign=top style=\"border: none; padding: 1em\"\n  {{{\n  #!html\n  <form action=\"/query\" method=\"get\"><div>\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"keywords\" value=\"~\" size=\"30\"/>\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Search by Keywords\"/>\n  <!-- To control what fields show up use hidden fields\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"id\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"summary\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"status\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"milestone\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"version\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"owner\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"priority\"/>\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"col\" value=\"component\"/>\n  -->\n  </div></form>\n  }}}\n}}}\n\n== Available Processors\n\nThe following processors are included in the Trac distribution:\n\n|| \'\'\'`#!default`\'\'\' || Present the text verbatim in a preformatted text block.

It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents. reStructuredText is designed for extensibility for specific application domains.\"\n\nIf you want a file from your Subversion repository to be displayed as reStructuredText in the Trac source browser, set `text/x-rst` as the value for the Subversion property `svn:mime-type`. See [trac:source:/trunk/INSTALL this example].\n\n=== Requirements\n\nTo activate RST support in Trac, install the python docutils package: `easy_install docutils`. If not already available on your operating system, you can download it at the [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html RST Website].\n\nDo not use the package manager of your OS, eg `apt-get install python-docutils`, because Trac will not find docutils then.\n\n=== More information on RST\n\n * reStructuredText Website -- http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html\n * RST Quick Reference -- http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/rst/quickref.html\n\n== Using RST in Trac\n\nTo specify that a block of text should be parsed using RST, use the \'\'rst\'\' processor. \n\n=== TracLinks in reStructuredText\n\n * Trac provides a custom RST directive `trac::` to allow TracLinks from within RST text.\n   ||= Wiki Markup ||= Display ||\n   {{{#!td\n     {{{\n     {{{\n     #!rst\n     This is a reference to |a ticket|\n\n     .. |a ticket| trac:: #42\n     }}}\n     }}}\n   }}}\n   {{{#!td\n     {{{\n     #!rst\n     This is a reference to |a ticket|\n\n     .. |a ticket| trac:: #42\n     }}}\n   }}}\n\n * Trac allows an even easier way of creating TracLinks in RST, using the custom `:trac:` role.\n   ||= Wiki Markup ||= Display ||\n   {{{#!td\n     {{{\n     {{{\n     #!rst\n     This is a reference to ticket `#12`:trac:\n\n     To learn how to use Trac, see `TracGuide`:trac:\n     }}}\n     }}}\n   }}}\n   {{{#!td\n     {{{\n     #!rst\n     This is a reference to ticket `#12`:trac:\n\n     To learn how to use Trac, see `TracGuide`:trac:\n     }}}\n   }}}\n\n For a complete example of all uses of the `:trac:` role, please see WikiRestructuredTextLinks. \n\n=== Syntax highlighting in reStructuredText\n\nThere is a directive for doing TracSyntaxColoring in RST as well. The directive is called code-block:\n\n||= Wiki Markup ||= Display ||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!rst\n\n  .. code-block:: python\n\n     class Test:\n\n         def TestFunction(self):\n             pass\n  \n  }}}\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  #!rst\n\n  .. code-block:: python\n\n     class Test:\n\n         def TestFunction(self):\n             pass\n\n  }}}\n}}}\nNote the need to indent the code at least one character after the `.. code-block` directive.\n\n=== Wiki Macros in reStructuredText\n\nTo enable [WikiMacros Wiki Macros] in RST, you use the same directive as for syntax highlighting, ie code-block:\n\n||= Wiki Markup ||= Display ||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!rst\n\n  .. code-block:: RecentChanges\n\n     Trac,3\n\n  }}}\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  #!rst\n\n  .. code-block:: RecentChanges\n\n     Trac,3\n\n  }}}\n}}}\n\nOr a more concise Wiki Macro-like syntax is also available, using the `:code-block:` role:\n\n||= Wiki Markup ||= Display ||\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  {{{\n  #!rst\n\n  :code-block:`RecentChanges:Trac,3`\n  }}}\n  }}}\n}}}\n{{{#!td\n  {{{\n  #!rst\n\n  :code-block:`RecentChanges:Trac,3`\n  }}}\n}}}\n\n=== Bigger RST Example\n\nThe example below should be self-explanatory:\n\n||= Wiki Markup ||= Display ||\n{{{#!td\n{{{\n#!html\n<pre class=\"wiki\">{{{\n#!rst\nFooBar Header\n=============\nreStructuredText is **nice**.
